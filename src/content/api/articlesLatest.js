We can spend hours discussing the intricacies of how particular cultural upbringings affect the way we view women.</p>\n\n<p>We can bore over the details of our past trauma in order to extract why exactly we’re so obsessed with certain types of porn.</p>\n\n<p>We can do all sorts of things to try and understand why we humans are the way we are, and to be quite frank&hellip; it’s all very exhausting.</p>\n\n<p>Because the truth is, overcoming pornography addiction is deceptively simple.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>From a process point of view, I spend around 40 minutes each day practicing meditation.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And that’s literally all I need to maintain control over my mind.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I also do a lot more, like train my mind with perspective exercises, but now that I&rsquo;m in a stable state in regards to my porn addiction, all I really have do is maintain my mental health.</p>\n\n<p>I now no longer think about porn. No longer do I crave porn. I wouldn’t even want to masturbate to porn if you put it in front of me.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s just not how my mind works anymore.</p>\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s so empowering.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>The point is that overcoming porn addiction is totally achievable.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And I want to show you how.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we have one rule here at NeverFap:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Practice. Practice. Practice.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Without practicing the core skills that will help you overcome porn addiction, you simply cannot overcome porn addiction. I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s no different whether you want to become a successful body builder or a world class sculptor. Practice is the bridge that will help get you there.</p>\n\n<p>You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.</p>\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s stopping you?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Cravings. Fear. Doubt. Anxiety. Addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say there&rsquo;s some kind of internal misunderstanding which is preventing you from doing what you want in your mind.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, a misunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a self-limiting belief. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t developed your awareness to a point that you can act with intention. Perhaps you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve never developed a single healthy coping mechanism at all in your entire life.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I came up with <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap\">The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</a> in order to help you better understand where you may be misunderstanding yourself.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Otherwise, known as denial.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If we had to break down what people tend to find difficult in regards to overcoming their porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>You could say that it comes down to a) Figuring out how to actually convince oneself to commit to porn recovery and b) Truly understanding what will work, and what will not.</p>\n\n<p>This not only includes the knowledge surrounding porn recovery, but also working with our emotions to effectively apply it in everyday situations.</p>\n\n<p>Which can be incredibly difficult, if not outright confusing when we don&rsquo;t truly have the confidence to know exactly what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll be feeling completely confident one week into our recovery, only to face what seems like an insurmountable wall of fear and doubt, which inevitably leads to relpase.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, that’s why I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>My intention is to help you fill in all the gaps, so you don’t have to run around like a headless chook, the same way that I did for five years.</p>\n\n<p>In this website, I hope to talk about every single aspect of how to successfully become porn free. What you’ll need to learn. How you can learn those things. How not to fall into certain traps.</p>\n\n<p>How it&rsquo;s actually an incredibly straight-forward process if you just follow the motions.</p>\n\n<p>I want to teach and explain all the core skills that I have come to learn over the past five years over <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/my-personal-porn-recovery-journey\">My Personal Porn Recovery Journey</a>, and I want to go into detail as to what these skills and understandings are.</p>\n\n<p>As for a non-exhaustive list of these skills, here are some of the things which you will learn which will help you overcome porn addiction:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Learn to focus on the how, not the why.</li>\n<li>Learn to value your mental health above all.</li>\n<li>Develop the ability to quiet and focus your mind.</li>\n<li>Learn to love and accept yourself and others unconditionally.</li>\n<li>Learn to invest in yourself.</li>\n<li>Change the way you think about sex and women.</li>\n<li>Value commitment and long-term thinking.</li>\n<li>Identify and understanding any potential mental disorders.</li>\n<li>Properly understand how to live life without porn.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>I explore each of these aspects (and more) in detail, as well as why they are so crucial for in regards to successfully overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Personally speaking it took me around 5 years of trial and error before everything finally clicked in my head.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And I’m now at a point where porn has no control over me.</p>\n\n<p>Realistically, you could probably achieve the same thing in around six months if you stuck to a rigorous routine.</p>\n\n<p>However, I also maintain that humans simply aren’t like that.</p>\n\n<p>Some of us are driven by failure and by experiencing things the hard way. Others of us may be so deep in our delusion that it may take years to even realise that we have a problem.</p>\n\n<p>That’s okay too.</p>\n\n<p>Understand that we’re not here to fight ourselves any longer.</p>\n\n<p>We’re here to understand who we are, what we have to do to change, as well as understand how we can improve as people.</p>\n","date":"2018-10-15","draft":false,"slug":"introduction-to-the-neverfap-deluxe-guide","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","popular","neverfap basics","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap deluxe guide","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/introduction-to-the-neverfap-deluxe-guide/","tldr1":"It is totally possible to overcome porn addiction by following a series of verifiable steps.","tldr2":"Practice is the key to achieving success.","tldr3":"You're likely struggling with porn addiction because of an internal misunderstanding of some fundamental truth.","tldr4":"I created NeverFap Deluxe to help you understand where you may be misunderstanding yourself.","tldr5":"","section":"articles"},{"title":"My Personal Porn Recovery Journey","page_id":"eca0234f-b8cb-468a-90af-c5623fc99aab","description":"This article explains my journey with porn addiction, along with some of the realisations I had along the way.","content":"<!-- Very Happy with edit -->\n\n<p>I came across porn at a very young age.</p>\n\n<p>I started watching porn from the very moment I figured out how to physically masturbate at the age of 10.</p>\n\n<p>And I&rsquo;m sure your story is quite similar.</p>\n\n<p>Discovering porn as a kid is like discovering Bitcoin as a young adult.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s this absurd hyper-fantasy that sucks you in and I really don&rsquo;t need to go into the details. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more than familiar with what it means to be someone who watches porn on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>It sucks.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure when I decided that I wanted to give up porn, but I suppose there have been a variety of serious attempts through out my life.</p>\n\n<p>My very first attempt at giving up porn began at age 16, where I thought I&rsquo;d try to give up porn for the hell of it.</p>\n\n<p>You know, because you&rsquo;re only ever 16 once, and I wanted to experience what 16 year old me could achieve.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I managed to abstain for approximately 3 weeks, until collapsing into a puddle of sweat and binge-mania.</p>\n\n<p>It then wasn&rsquo;t until I was around 20 years old that I began to recognise that porn was an actual problem in my life, if not from the simple perspective of being an addict.</p>\n\n<p>A problem which I was determined to understand and overcome.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Age 25. October 20th 2018.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The last time in my entire life that I will have ever masturbated to, or ever watched porn.</p>\n\n<p>A commitment that I have upheld until today, rather effortlessly.</p>\n\n<p>You know when you have that moment when everything clicks, and absolutely everything comes together and makes sense?</p>\n\n<p>I was the guy who had that moment, and I&rsquo;ve been in control of myself ever since.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to detail all the changes that occurred within that five year period, we&rsquo;d literally be here all day.</p>\n\n<p>Because, you know.</p>\n\n<p>A lot changes over the five year span of anyone&rsquo;s life, and the best we can do is look back in retrospect and identify the things that went right.</p>\n\n<p>So up until then, here&rsquo;s what I was doing right:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Done the whole Paleo diet thing</li>\n<li>Studied various books and perspective course on mental health</li>\n<li>Took cold showers everyday before bed</li>\n<li>Ate only one meal a day (via intermittent fasting)</li>\n<li>Was doing Leangains and lifting weights three times a week</li>\n<li>Was in an amazing, supportive relationship</li>\n<li>Worked obscenely hard to get a job as a programmer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>Truth was, I was doing almost everything right.</p>\n\n<p>Yet none of that actually mattered, because it was those small things that I wasn&rsquo;t doing, which made the other 90% of my effort null.</p>\n\n<p>Today I want to share what those things are with you are, and why they were arguably more important than anything I&rsquo;d done up until then.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose there were two main things that happened, which helped me better understand exactly what I had to do to address my porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>And it all happened within the space of a few weeks.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>For starters I had a breakdown.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>You see, I suffer from a condition from Bipolar Disorder, and it was something I hadn&rsquo;t told my partner about.</p>\n\n<p>In part, because I just assumed she already knew, but primarily because I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who will ask for help from others.</p>\n\n<p>However, one day I was feeling particularly vulnerable and I realised one very important thing, which I maintain is important to this day:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It's impossible to do it alone.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The reason why you break down is because for most people, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to admit that you have a problem, and so mentally you just turn to jelly.</p>\n\n<p>At first, she didn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Because I&rsquo;d never mentioned it once in our 4 year relationship. But when it kicked in that it was actually something I was hiding from her this whole time, it made a lot of sense.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, a few things happened as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Now that she was aware of my disorder, I was now able to be honest about all the things I was hiding from her. In particular, my porn addiction which was in part a coping mechanism for my Bipolar.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Which as a result, gave me this surreal confidence to actually address my porn addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>For whatever reason, when you get everything off your chest, it just completely changes everything.</p>\n\n<p>You no longer feel guilt for who you are and you no longer see yourself as a monster.</p>\n\n<p>You merely see your actions as a symptom of something greater, which allows you to not take them personally, and not react to them negatively.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it also meant that I could ask for help and support when required. I could tell her that I was struggling with my porn addiction, and not feel judged or vindicated.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding and recognising my disorder, which I&rsquo;d previously dismissed, helped me better understand my emotions and therefore, manage them a lot more easily.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I finally felt free to just move on with my life.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible to understate what that feels like.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing which happened, which came about in large part due to my breakdown and coming out about my Bipolar, was equally if not more profound in terms of addressing my porn addiction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Essentially, I'd discovered this thing called meditation.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The funny thing about meditation is that I&rsquo;d tried doing it through out various phases of my life to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps all that effort had accumulated up until then, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, up until then I&rsquo;d failed to see the value in the meditation.</p>\n\n<p>However following my break down, I&rsquo;d decided to take my mental health seriously, and I was determined to do everything in my power to get better.</p>\n\n<p>A friend at work had mentioned the benefits of meditation in his life, as well as a popular guided meditation course which he swore his life by.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to do this course, which was basically a 10 minute commitment before bed each day, and my gosh.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I can happily say that within two weeks of meditating I'd learnt more about how to manage my porn addiction than in absolutely everything I've done in the past five years to try and curb my addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>All because of a simple 10 minute practice before bed.</p>\n\n<p>Absolutely incredible.</p>\n\n<p>The primary reason for this is because meditating allowed me to effectively control and manage my emotions</p>\n\n<p>Primarily, the practice of meditation provided me with the ability to fully control my mind, something which I hadn&rsquo;t experienced before.</p>\n\n<p>It allowed me to relax my mind at will. To prevent incessant thinking and most importantly, not take my emotions and what I was feeling personally.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>If I had one piece of advice to anyone wanting to seriously overcome their porn addiction, it would be to start meditating today.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It is possibly the most essential thing you can do to assist you in overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, what&rsquo;s also important is how you meditate, and that&rsquo;s precisely what I cover in this website.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a form of meditation I personally find incredibly useful is walking in public, and simply avoiding placing our attention on people walking past us.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>The next steps in my journey</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve managed to successfully overcome porn addiction, I want to help you do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Often the best way to learn something is to teach others how to do that same thing, and so that&rsquo;s what I want to do with NeverFap.</p>\n\n<p>To create a vibrant resource for other porn addicts to learn from, so we no longer have to struggle and cause harm in life due to the effects of addiction.</p>\n\n<p>The information is all here.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"/guide\">Get started</a> today.</p>\n","date":"2018-10-22","draft":false,"slug":"my-personal-porn-recovery-journey","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","popular","porn recovery","neverfap basics","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/my-personal-porn-recovery-journey/","tldr1":"I last watched porn in October 20th 2018.","tldr2":"The first reason why I've managed to succeed is because I came out about my disorder to my partner.","tldr3":"The second reason why I've managed to succeed is because I began practicing meditation.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"articles"},{"title":"The Five Fundamental Principles Of NeverFap","page_id":"162ba636-b500-42fb-bd1f-5fe9d0c76993","description":"The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap are a series of principles which help you easily and efficiently address your porn addiction.","content":"<!-- Very happy with edit -->\n\n<p>The NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction comprises of five core principles.</p>\n\n<p>Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated skills which you must develop in order to successfully address your porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Without mastery of all five of these principles, we cannot hope to consistently manage the emotions, thoughts and  behaviours which may be contributing towards our porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>For more of a relaxed introduction, I highly recommend reading my article <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/the-five-principles-of-neverfap-as-they-relate-to-my-life\">The Five Principles Of Neverfap As They Relate To My Life</a> which explains how they apply to my own life.</p>\n\n<p>Before we begin, we must ask ourselves a very important question:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What is a fundamental principle and what makes it fundamental?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>A fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, nor even how you understand or interpret it.</p>\n\n<p>It simply is.</p>\n\n<p>You may attempt to dispute these fundamental truths or argue against their validity, which is perfectly fine if that is your intention.</p>\n\n<p>However it certainly won&rsquo;t help you overcome porn addiction, which is the primary reason why you&rsquo;re here. You know, to receive help for a problem that you cannot do alone.</p>\n\n<p>My intention on the other hand is very clear. I am here to help you overcome porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>So in order to do this, we must first set some ground rules and truly understand exactly what we&rsquo;re getting ourselves into.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Ground rules</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing to understand about fundamental principles is that they are not subject to open-ended thinking.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Well, my mind doesn&rsquo;t really work like that.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;While that may be true, I don&rsquo;t personally allow it to affect me in that way.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>This is not how fundamental principles operate.</p>\n\n<p>Hard truths are not open to subjective questioning. Certainly, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to question them if you like, however it won&rsquo;t help you with your porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a very specific word that is used to describe when people refuse to accept the fundamental basis of reality.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It's called denial.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Whether you realise it or not, the reason why you are a porn addict is because you are in denial about some aspect of your life.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of what you are capable of as a human being. Perhaps you have a low opinion of your self-worth. Maybe you never had the chance to develop any healthy coping mechanisms growing up.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the aim of these five fundamental principles is to help you expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.</p>\n\n<p>As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the unfamiliar.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot get better if you cannot first recognise that you have a problem.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there is no fundamental principle along the lines of &ldquo;Never visit a porn website ever again&rdquo; or &ldquo;You should never willingly orgasm&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with porn itself.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, porn addiction is merely a symptom of a wider range of problems which NeverFap aims to address.</p>\n\n<p>So without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap:</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">01 - Choice over mind</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>While all these principles are important in their own right, this is perhaps the one that people tend to struggle with most.</p>\n\n<p>Or rather, it is a way of thinking and understanding which is completely foreign to most of us, and even those of us who do not have a porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>What <strong>Choice over mind</strong> iterates is the fact that you have complete control over your mind.</p>\n\n<p>This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your mind, whether you agree it&rsquo;s possible to have full control over your mind, or whether you&rsquo;ve even experienced having full control over your mind.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What's important to understand is that your mind is fundamentally capable of being controlled.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>I would personally say that this fundamental principle is both equal parts understanding and practice.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly while practicing and exercising choice is important, understanding the extent to which we have choice will help us gain the confidence to truly feel comfortable dictating our thoughts, feelings, emotions and behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>By in large, the way this confidence is achieved is through controlled meditation and perspective training, which is covered extensively throughout the <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices\">NeverFap Deluxe Practices</a> section.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a situation where many porn addicts believe they do not have control is in public.</p>\n\n<p>Many porn addicts (particularly male porn addicts) have a tendency to stare at women they find attractive in public. In particular, control over staring at hot women in public.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that with daily practice, we can learn to develop control over our mind, and completely filter the women we walk past in public altogether.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">02 - Balance over reward</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is one of those concepts that people think they understand, and yet refutely misunderstand simply because of how obliviously unbalanced they are to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s something most people outright ignore because they don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;that big of a deal&rdquo;, not quite understanding the consequences that ignoring balance can have on their life.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, denial.</p>\n\n<p>What <strong>Balance over reward</strong> maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our immediate wants and goals.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Often we become so affixated with something, either through obsession or neglect, we fail to consider the wider ramifications of our actions.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>So we cut corners in order to achieve or experience what we want, only to face the consequences of our actions later.</p>\n\n<p>Not realising that the reason why we&rsquo;re struggling is because of the corners that we&rsquo;ve cut.</p>\n\n<p>For example, overworking ourselves is a prominent example of cutting corners in order to achieve something at the immediate harm to both our physical and mental health.</p>\n\n<p>We stay up late to finish what we&rsquo;re working on, ruining our sleep schedule and ability to regulate stress. We most cases, resort to caffeine and porn to keep us energised, resulting in addiction and dysfunction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>And yet, we're so focused on the outcome that we don't quite realise what we're even doing wrong.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Rather, we feel justified in our actions, inspite of the fact that we recognise that we may have a problem with addiction or our mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Even though a) Cutting corners makes you less productive overall than if you were functioning normally and b) Having the added effect of ruining your mental health physical health in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, by learning to respect the principle of balance in your life, you can actually get more done overall without burning out, and without the constant baggage of emotional volatility and stress.</p>\n\n<p>I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of believing they&rsquo;re inherently unique when it comes to cutting corners.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>They think they can somehow \"cheat\" the system and come out ahead.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Put simply, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>\n\n<p>No one is immune to their own biology.</p>\n\n<p>Even though people may not show it (in most cases, they simply know how to hide it very effectively), there is a hard limit to what everyone can do on a daily basis without it affecting their mental health.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that if we are to overcome our porn addiction, we must respect this limit and embrace balance in everything we do.</p>\n\n<p>This means taking breaks, even when we want to push forward. This means challenging ourselves, even if we don&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>\n\n<p>And by learning to value and respect these boundaries, you may gain a significant amount of control over your life.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.</p>\n\n<p>It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns in our life, as well as serve as a stop-gap between our thoughts and our actions.</p>\n\n<p>What <strong>Awareness over all</strong> maintains is that having awareness over our actions is critical to not only understanding the impact those actions may have over our own lives, but also how we can learn to gain control over them.</p>\n\n<p>Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount of intention, nor understand the responsibility we have over them.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Instead, we allow our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs to take over and continue their self-destructive patterns.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>I think the reason why most people struggle with this concept of awareness is because:</p>\n\n<p>a) They&rsquo;re not currently aware, nor understand how to be aware because it&rsquo;s not something they&rsquo;ve ever practiced.</p>\n\n<p>b) Most people struggle to even understand what this concept of awareness actually is. (I was certainly one of them)</p>\n\n<p>In reality, awareness is actually really simple.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Awareness is your ability to sense the world around you.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s literally it.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about focusing your mind or trying really hard not to think, or even trying to figure out how to empty the thoughts in your mind.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, they may be useful skills and they may be a consequence of practicing awareness, however the actual action of awareness itself is simple.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It is simply being present with your senses.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Pretty neat, huh?</p>\n\n<p>And when you&rsquo;re present with your senses and what you&rsquo;re feeling, it provides you with the ability to control and gauge your experience.</p>\n\n<p>Witout reaction, and without taking what you&rsquo;re experiencing it personally.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Essentially, the basis of this principle is that the simplest path is often the most efficient.</p>\n\n<p>And as humans, we instinctly do what we find most simple, either for better or worse.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Therefore, solutions which are simple by design are going to be more effective than solutions which are convoluted.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the reason why I personally follow the paleo diet and only eat one meal a day.</p>\n\n<p>Doing this is vastly more simple than counting calories, obsessing over when I can eat and organising three meals a day.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, simple is often easy.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Certainly, part of the reason why we're addicted to porn in the first place is because it's the easy thing to do.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Back to the principle itself, what <u><em>Struggle over none</em></u> relates to is this idea that if you&rsquo;re really struggling with someone, then you&rsquo;re probably not doing it right.</p>\n\n<p>Which means either you&rsquo;re not understanding it intuitively, or you&rsquo;re fundamentally misunderstanding what you&rsquo;re trying to understand.</p>\n\n<p>For example, understanding that porn recovery isn&rsquo;t about fighting yourself or forcing yourself to &ldquo;get through it&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>If at any point you feel like you have to force yourself to do something, then it indicates that you&rsquo;re doing something incorrectly or more importantly, not actually recovering from porn addiction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because life without porn isn't a struggle.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the most liberating and empowering things you can do.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway being that life only ever becomes a chore when we act against it or neglect it.</p>\n\n<p>Especially when it comes to addressing porn addiction.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">05 - Uncondition over judgement</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Much like Balance over reward, this is one of those principles that people tend to ignore, because they underestimate the ramifications of ignoring it.</p>\n\n<p><u>Uncondition over judgement</u> is about pursing acceptance over judgement.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into a limited point of view.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the reason why it may not seem like a mental trap is because at first, making one judgement isn&rsquo;t going to kill you.</p>\n\n<p>But humans never just make one judgement.</p>\n\n<p>We make thousands of judgements each and every day, each time moulding our perception of who we are and what we know.</p>\n\n<p>And when we make enough of these judgements, they can form into habits of belief which prevent us from exercising awareness.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>After all, how can you be aware of what's going on in your mind, if your mind is in a constant state of habitual thinking?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, and the more faith that gets placed into ideas of who you are and what the world is.</p>\n\n<p>It becomes a trap because without realising it, through judgement you end up in a state of habitual unawareness, full of harmful behaviours that we have no idea how to control or influence.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine trying to address something like porn addiction under this state of mind.</p>\n\n<p>It becomes almost impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Because guess what happens when you invest all your faith into a bunch of fruitless ideas?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>You end up having no capacity to address the problems in your life which actually has meaning, like your porn addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Remember, there are consequences to everything you do in life, whether you realise it or not.</p>\n\n<p>So there you go.</p>\n\n<p>The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully you have a better idea of what the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap are, as well as what they represent.</p>\n\n<p>They exist to help guide you through your porn recovery journey, as well as help you make healthy decisions.</p>\n\n<p>If ever you get confused about anything, it can help to come back to these five principles, or try to assess what you might be doing incorrectly.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because at the end of the day, overcoming porn addiction is completely within your reach.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>You just have to know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing and why.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward I recommend checking out the article index which contains further information in regards to the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<div class=\"button__wrapper\">\n  <a class=\"button button__secondary\" href=\"/articles\">NeverFap Deluxe Article Index.</a>\n</div>\n","date":"2018-10-29","draft":false,"slug":"the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","popular","porn recovery","neverfap basics","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap/","tldr1":"Fundamental principles are hard truths, irrespective of how you think about them.","tldr2":"These principles have little to do with porn, because porn recovery has nothing to do with porn.","tldr3":"There are Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"articles"},{"title":"The One Rule Of NeverFap","page_id":"cc456b7f-7fc7-4eb8-9e65-da04cac7a783","description":"Practicing meditation and awareness exercises on a daily basis is the only thing that matters for your porn recovery.","content":"<!-- Very happy with edit -->\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss a NeverFap best case scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a list of metrics that reflect a very healthy attitude towards life.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You no longer watch porn.</li>\n<li>You no longer crave watching porn.</li>\n<li>Pornography isn’t something you ever think about, at all.</li>\n<li>You no longer stare at women in public.

and hope that we have some sudden spark of awareness which will magically alter our brain so as not to pursue the behaviours we&rsquo;ve been doing since we were a young child.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck with that.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there’s a word used to describe what it means to incessantly ask &lsquo;why&rsquo; all the time.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It’s called rumination.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And I personally consider it a form of self-harm.</p>\n\n<p>Rumination is when you continually spur over your thoughts, without actually pursuing any hard actions as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Understandably, it is an instinctive human response to ask why.</p>\n\n<p>But when we do it excessively, it serves no purpose and it becomes a literal bottleneck in terms of affecting our ability to process and produce information.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Which is to say that asking why is great for creating an initial assessment, however beyond that it becomes nothing more than a harmful burden.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If we look at something like learning to play basketball, it&rsquo;s clear there are a number of key skills we must learn.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there&rsquo;s dribbling, shooting, blocking and learning to run with the ball.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter if you don&rsquo;t understand what materials a basketball is made of, nor even who invented basketball.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what your understanding of the sentiment behind basketball, those are the core skills you are going to have to learn.</p>\n\n<!-- Which is to say that while dribbling is important, practicing dribbling  -->\n\n<!-- \n\n is something which may help you better understand those skills, however the core skills themselves are undeniable.\n\n -->\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Another way of putting it is that we must focus on the how, rather than the why.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If it helps you can think of the understanding is the &lsquo;why&rsquo;, while the core skills are the &lsquo;how&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>When we focus on how to achieve something, we no longer become concerned with trying to define our circumstances using pre-existing knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we become actively focused on actions which will help us change our reality for the better.</p>\n\n<p>Questions such as:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;How am I a porn addict?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What do I on a daily basis which makes me a porn addict?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What do I have to do in order to avoid porn addiction?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>From reasons to tangible processes, you also completely change the way you think about your own problems.</p>\n\n<p>No longer do they become about building narratives or perceptions of who you are. Instead, they become about the mechanical details of what makes you a porn addict.</p>\n\n<p>Because at the end of the day, addiction is a process.</p>\n\n<p>It is something you actively engage in and contribute towards, whether you quite realise it or not.</p>\n\n<p>And although attempting to understand why you may be engaged in this process may seem useful, it is also a really indirect way of trying to influence how it functions.</p>\n\n<p>To be a little bit more precise, here are a list of the whys which you shouldn&rsquo;t concern yourself with:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Why am I a porn addict?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Why do I find overcoming porn addiction so difficult?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>These are all meaningless questions.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, these are the types of questions we need to be thinking about:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What can I do to influence my porn addiction?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What are the steps leading up to when I watch porn?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;How do I think about women?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;How do I fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to watch porn?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>Aside from the rest of the introductory articles on this website, I highly recommend taking a look at some of the practices on offer, so you can begin to make actual changes to your life today.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this article clarifies the change of thinking that needs to take place, in order for us to overcome our porn addiction.</p>\n","date":"2018-11-13","draft":false,"slug":"why-am-i-a-porn-addict","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","porn recovery","neverfap basics","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics","NoFap Companion"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/why-am-i-a-porn-addict/","tldr1":"Asking why we are has little to do with actually changing who we are.","tldr2":"Over asking why is a process called rumination, and it is a form of self-harm","tldr3":"Actions are responsible for helping us change.
