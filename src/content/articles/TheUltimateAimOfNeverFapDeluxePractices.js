<Text>NeverFap Deluxe consists of a range of exercises which are designed to help you develop the skills in order to help you overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text>The intention is really quite simple:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>To help you develop healthy coping mechanisms in order to help you deal with your porn addiction.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Exercises which are designed to not only help expand your capacity for capacity for awareness, however to also teach you to remain calm and relaxed with your feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>Here&rsquo;s the thing: As a porn addict you have trained your mind to watch porn as a go-to response to a variety of difficult situations.</Text>

<Text>It could as a response to excessive stress due to work or school. It could be due to depression as a result of unsupportive family or friends. It could simply be due to the fact that you&rsquo;ve never be taught otherwise.</Text>

<Text>What these exercises set out to do is reprogram the way you think and respond in these situations.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Essentially, what this means is developing a new set of understandings and behaviours so you don't need to watch porn anymore to cope with these difficult situations.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>And the way we get you to do this is by practicing these healthy coping mechanisms so that they can become second-nature to you.</Text>

<Text>So that you can learn to relax and even accept those negative feelings and not take them personally.</Text>

<h2>Encouraging self-discovery</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>An important thing to note is that what we&rsquo;re truly embarking on is a process of self-discovery.</Text>

<Text>Which is to say that there are no right or wrong answers with these exercises and that there is merely how you feel in the present moment.</Text>

<Text>As a result, observation is an incredibly important aspect of what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve here, because observation is what allows us to engage our brain and think about these feelings and behaviours in a meaningful behaviour.</Text>

<Text>While awareness is certainly one factor, consciously engaging with our behaviours is equally as important as well.</Text>

<Text>Otherwise, we aren&rsquo;t truly being aware in a way that is helping us replace our unhealthy coping mechanisms, with more suitable alternatives.</Text>

<h3>Helping ourselves</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>At the end of the day, the ultimate aim of NeverFap Deluxe Practices is to help you better understand ourselves.</Text>

<Text>Currently, we may not even know how to observe our sense, let alone understand what awareness actually is.</Text>

<Text>Through these exercises we can learn to better appreciate these aspects of our lives, and furthermore, utilise them as a strategy to help us improve our mental processes.</Text>

<Text>The aim is to overcome our porn addiction, and there&rsquo;s no better way I know how than through calmness and awareness.</Text>
