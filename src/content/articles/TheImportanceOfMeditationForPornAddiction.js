<Text>Meditation is the single most important thing you can do for your porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>In fact, ten minutes of meditation each day is probably enough for most porn addicts to overcome their addiction.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>No, seriously.</Text>

<Text>It really is that simple.</Text>

<Text>Of course, the reason why this doesn&rsquo;t happen is because most porn addicts are completely oblivious as to the benefits of meditation.</Text>

<Text>Not to mention, most porn addicts have a hard time sticking to a routine of meditation, which is entirely necessary in order for it to be successful.</Text>

<Text>Which is why the other 99% of this website exists, to help you understand why it&rsquo;s absolutely vital.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Why meditation?</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>Without diving too deep into the intricate details of how to meditate, nor necessarily what meditation actually is, let&rsquo;s start off by talking about what meditation effectively achieves.</Text>

<Text>In essence, meditation is the most powerful way for you to regain power over your emotions.</Text>

<Text>Not just your emotions, but your thoughts, feelings and everything else associated with the inherent functioning of your brain.</Text>

<Text>Here&rsquo;s the deal, being a porn addict has changed the way your brain works.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s no longer stable.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s no longer doing exactly what you want it to.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>What meditation allows you to do is develop the ability to maintain control over your mind.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>So you no longer feel compelled to watch porn.</Text>

<Text>Of course, porn may not even be the reason why you lack the ability to control your mind.</Text>

<Text>It may be that you never developed those healthy coping mechanisms growing up, and that it was inevitable you were going to be become addicted to porn or engage in other self-harming behaviour as a result.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, this is the category that most people fit into.</Text>

<h2>Meditation and Porn addiction</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>Overcoming porn addiction is actually a relatively straight-forward process.</Text>

<Text>It largely comes down to developing control over your emotions, as well as developing an understanding of how your mind works.</Text>

<Text>In terms of developing control over your emotions, it means practicing meditation on a daily basis so that you can remain calm and collected irrespective of what may be happening external to your mind.</Text>

<Text>In terms of understanding your own emotions, it&rsquo;s about having the capacity to not take your own emotions personally, and to remain calm when you feel as if your emotions are out of your control.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>If you can manage those two things, you'll more-or-less be 90% of the way there to overcoming your porn addiction.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>Yet most people struggle.</Text>

<Text>Precisely because they don&rsquo;t do those things.</Text>

<Text>They don&rsquo;t meditate on a frequent basis. They don&rsquo;t understand their emotions.</Text>

<Text>They don&rsquo;t know how to maintain control over their minds, and yet they wonder why they struggle.</Text>

<Text>This is precisely the reason why meditation is important, because it provides us with the ability to face these challenges without hesitation or fear.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>When you have control over your emotions, it makes situations where you don't necessarily feel in control manageable.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Yes.</Text>

<Text>Manageable.</Text>

<Text>Because successfully overcoming porn addiction is largely about learning to navigate through your emotions, and manage them so that you can be in control of your desired outcomes.</Text>

<Text>And you can&rsquo;t manage your emotions if you don&rsquo;t have mastery over your mind, along with your ability to produce and regulate them.</Text>

<Text>So what exactly are some of the skills and practices of meditation?</Text>

<Text>For starters, there&rsquo;s observation.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Observation is perhaps the most fundamental skill you can learn in regards to developing your awareness.</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>It is the skill we will focus on and develop most throughout the practices here on NeverFap Deluxe.</Text>



<Text>In part, because it&rsquo;s really hard to take something personally or lose our frame of reference when we&rsquo;re merely observing reality.</Text>

<Text>As opposed to being invested in it with our own personal beliefs, thoughts and judgements</Text>

<Text>Aside from observation, there is also introspection (our ability to look into ourselves), perspective (changing the way we think about things), as well as a whole range of different skills.</Text>

<Text>These skills are broken into Five Fundamental Principles which allow us to focus on particular outcomes related to overcoming porn addiction.</Text>

<Text>I recommend checking out our list of NeverFap Deluxe Practices for a list of exercises you can do to develop awareness in your life.</Text>
