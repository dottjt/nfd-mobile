          <Text style={content__title}>The Easiest Way To Not Take Our Emotions Personally</Text>
          <Text>There are times when our emotions can feel unmanagable.</Text>

<Text>For example, we may be feeling intensely anxious about a date we have planned for that night, or we may even be feeling trapped and under the pressure to perform well at school or in our jobs.</Text>

<Text>All situations which pique our urge to masturbate or watch porn, to a point where we can&rsquo;t help but feel as if we have no choice but to give in.</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, when we lose control over our emotions, we lose control over our ability to act effectively and it&rsquo;s these situations where we can begin to spiral down the path of relapse and helplessness.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>All situations where we collapse because we decide to give into our emotions and take them personally.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>And this really signifies the importance of why we shouldn&rsquo;t take our emotions personally.</Text>

<Text>Not only in order to be effective with our emotions, however also because these situations are inevitably going to arise in the early stages of our recovery.</Text>

<Text>Therefore, shouldn&rsquo;t be used as an excuse or perceived barrier to our recovery, when it&rsquo;s something literally everyone goes through.</Text>

<Text>For many of us, being unable to effectively manage our emotions forms part of the reason why we&rsquo;re still addicted to porn.</Text>

<Text>In fact, learning to be able to effectively manage our emotions is usually the first hurdle most of us face when it comes to addressing our porn addiction.</Text>

<Text>We have a craving, we hesitate, we attempt to postpone it (usually unsuccessfully), and then we eventually give in.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>It's where many of us are stuck mentally, and that's why I'm here to help.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>I want to start off by saying that learning not to take your emotions personally is actually a super simple process once you understand the dynamics of how we take things personally.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, the first thing to understand about taking something personally is that it&rsquo;s often a subconscious response.</Text>

<Text>Which is to say that it usually manifests itself as an instant emotional reaction, rather than as part of an informed decision we&rsquo;ve made prior to the emotion reaction.</Text>

<Text>Otherwise we simply wouldn&rsquo;t bother with the drama, and we&rsquo;d avoid wasting all our energy getting worked up.</Text>

<Text>Yet because we&rsquo;re largely not aware of our own behaviours which cause us to reach this point, we end up going down a dangerous path where we lose control over our emotions.</Text>

<Text>Often because we&rsquo;ve simply never been taught otherwise.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>So what typically happens when we feel uncomfortable with our emotions, is that we try to assume control over them.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Mentally on some level we think:</Text>

<Text><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;If I can force guilt or negativity onto myself, then I might be able to push myself to react differently.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text>or</Text>

<Text><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;If I try really hard to distract myself, then I&rsquo;ll forget about these feelings and they won&rsquo;t be able to affect me.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text>Essentially, we attempt to manipulate ourselves in the hope that it will help us achieve a positive end result.</Text>

<Text>A common example of this (in the case of anxiety, for example) is to talk ourselves up as a form of motivation.</Text>

<Text><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;I can do it! There&rsquo;s no reason to feel sad at all!&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text>We tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re smart, confident and in-control - even though deep-down inside, our feelings are telling us otherwise.</Text>

<Text>And so rather than making us feel better, it ends up making us feel worse about ourselves.</Text>

<Text>In other cases, this can even manifest from anger and frustration:</Text>

<Text><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;F*ck you PMO! I will conquer you!&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text>And the funny thing, is that none of these strategies work. In the end, it merely exhausts us as deep-down inside it&rsquo;s not what we actually believe about ourselves.</Text>

<Text>So here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Instead, we're going to refrain entirely.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>And refraining from our emotions is the simplest way we can learn not take our emotions personally.</Text>

<Text>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the million dollar answer you were looking forward, however it is the correct approach in terms of learning to develop control over our minds.</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, there are no cheap hacks.</Text>

<Text>There are good practices and your commitment to them through practice and consistency.</Text>

<Text>So to reiterate, the easiest way to deal with your emotions is to refrain from interacting with them.</Text>

<Text>Now, where a lot of confusion comes from is this idea of what &ldquo;refraining&rdquo; truly means.</Text>

<Text>For example, some people misconstrue it for meaning &ldquo;distraction&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text>So in the case of being anxious, going and watching a calming YouTube video to cope with your difficult emotions.</Text>

<Text>Now it&rsquo;s important that we really think about this.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Because going and watching a calming YouTube video is actually a form of reaction.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>It&rsquo;s you reacting to your anxiety by indirectly finding an activity to preoccupy you from thinking about it.</Text>

<Text>This directly contradicts this idea of refraining, which instead means to remain calm and relaxed in the face of these emotions.</Text>

<Text>Which often means sitting there and choosing to consciously relax and engage in meditation, rather than find something to do to change what you&rsquo;re currently feeling.</Text>

<Text>In layman&rsquo;s terms, refraining from taking your emotions personally is a bit like saying, &ldquo;Thank you, but no thank you.&rdquo; to your emotions.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s a form of acknowledgement where you recognise that you&rsquo;re in control, without allow them to have power over you.</Text>

<Text>Because when you react, you actually give that train of thought power.</Text>

<Text>When you react what you&rsquo;re mentally communicating is.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>"Yes, these feelings are valid and now I am going to address them and respond to them".</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Which is the opposite what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve with refraining from reaction at all.</Text>

<Text>Now, while we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of theory in regards to refraining and why we shouldn&rsquo;t take things personally, actually practicing this is a different story.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, in order to refrain effectively we must develop our skills of conscious awareness.</Text>

<Text>The reason why this is important is that it will allow us to identify situations where we take our emotions personally, and instead learn to change those behaviours.</Text>

<Text>And the only way we can develop our conscious awareness is by practicing awareness on a daily basis.</Text>

<Text>We provide a variety of awareness exercises via the NeverFap Deluxe Practices section.</Text>

<Text>Then, you&rsquo;l have a much easier time learning not to take your own emotions personally.</Text>

<Text>As well as remain calm in the face of emotional uncertainty.</Text>
