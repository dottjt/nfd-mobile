<Text>NeverFap is a comprehensive method of overcoming porn addiction.</Text>

<Text>It is the easiest and most effective method I know, based on my own experiences with overcoming porn addiction over the past five years.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>I would describe NeverFap as a system which is designed to give you self-control.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Self-control over your mind. Self-control over your actions. Self-control over your thoughts, feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>Now, chances are that none of this is new to you.</Text>

<Text>Chances are that you have been attempting self-control in some form or another for a while now, however it just hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out.</Text>

<Text>Maybe your porn cravings still get the best of you. Maybe you feel as if you don&rsquo;t even have control over your mood and emotions.</Text>

<Text>Maybe you&rsquo;ve completely normalised all these feelings and you don&rsquo;t believe that self-control is even possible.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Well, chances are that you've been doing it wrong this whole time.</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>Certainly, I was doing it completely wrong for the first five years of my porn recovery and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</Text>

<Text>We all learn differently. We all have different life experiences.</Text>

<Text>That&rsquo;s just how humans are.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>The thing to understand about self-control is that it's completely counter-intuitive.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive in the sense that since you don&rsquo;t have self-control, everything that you currently know has no relation to helping you understand self-control.</Text>

<Text>Porn addicts don&rsquo;t know about self-control.</Text>

<Text>Porn addicts know about being addicted to porn, because that&rsquo;s what they are.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s what they live on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s how they understand and relate to the world around them.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>So there's a few steps we must take in order to address this.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>For starters, we need to learn self-control from someone who knows how.</Text>

<Text>Which is easier said than done, because this then requires a change in attitude which you may not be used to.</Text>

<Text>For example, in order to learn something from someone this entails both trust and commitment.</Text>

<Text>Two things which porn addicts generally don&rsquo;t have.</Text>

<Text>Porn addicts are generally skeptics and can barely commit to anything, since they don&rsquo;t already have control over their emotions.</Text>

<Text>In part because they over-rely on their emotions, which change in an instant from &ldquo;I can do this!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Man, I really need to watch porn&rdquo;.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>So what hope is there?</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Well, it can help to understand that no one is expecting you to beat this thing within a day.</Text>

<Text>Overcoming porn addiction is the kind of thing which may take you years to not only understand and process.</Text>

<Text>What the NeverFap method does is start you with small commitments, so that you can more easily work up to larger ones.</Text>

<Text>A key thing to understand is that learning self-control, and really anything for that matter, isn&rsquo;t driven by goals and expectations.</Text>

<Text>Learning is driven by the small things you do each day to practice it.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instead, the problem is that you're spending so much time fighting these goals and expectations.</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>That you don&rsquo;t feel motivated, nor even comfortable committing to these practices, due to fear, doubt and a whole trope of negative emotions.</Text>

<Text>And you&rsquo;re fighting these goals and expectations, why?</Text>

<Text>Well, as I said earlier.</Text>

<Text>Self-control is counter-intuitive for those addicted to porn.</Text>

<Text>Often the reason why we&rsquo;ve set these goals and expectations in the first place, is because that is what we understand will help us move forward.</Text>

<Text>Chances are that this is what we learnt as kids, or perhaps it is all we have ever known.</Text>

<Text>Again, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</Text>

<Text>We&rsquo;re not here to judge, nor condemn. We&rsquo;re here to learn and become better people.</Text>

<Text>In order to address this, the NeverFap method takes a strong focus on practicing meditation.</Text>

<Text>Put simply.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Meditation is easiest and most effective way that I know how to develop self-control.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>The primary skill we will be learning in regards to meditation is observation.</Text>

<Text>If I had to describe the most important skill you can learn to help you overcome your porn addiction, I would say that observation is that skill.</Text>

<Text>Observation truly encompasses the default state of mind that you should be in almost all of the time.</Text>



<Text>And furthermore, developing observation is easy.</Text>
