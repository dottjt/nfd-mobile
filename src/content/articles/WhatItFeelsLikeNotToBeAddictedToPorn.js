          <Text style={content__title}>What It Feels Like Not To Be Addicted To Porn</Text>
          <Text>One thing which people often ask me is:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What does it feel like not to be addicted to porn?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>And it&rsquo;s an interesting question, because it&rsquo;s something I often think about and I think I&rsquo;ve finally found a way to convey this message accurately.</Text>

<Text>If I had to provide an appropriate analogy which summarises what it feels like not to be addicted to porn, I would ask you to think back to when you were 7 years&rsquo; old.</Text>

<Text>Now, for most people this is a rather distant memory.</Text>

<Text>I personally remember very little about what my life was like back then, although if I had to approximate I would say that I was in Grade 2 and that I had a relatively simple life.</Text>

<Text>I don&rsquo;t remember any particular details, the people in it, nor is it something which really evokes any sort of emotion, regret or anything.</Text>

<Text>It just was a period of time within which I existed, no different to my existence now.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Well, that memory kind of sums up how I also feel about my previous porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Which is to say that my porn addiction is a lot like a distant memory to me.</Text>

<Text>While I remember the attachment and depression that resulted from it, I don&rsquo;t remember a whole lot of the specifics in terms of why I did it, nor even what it felt like.</Text>

<Text>Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t really have any feelings towards it, since I haven&rsquo;t experienced the guilt, shame and sadness that arose from my habit in quite a very long time.</Text>

<Text>Instead, you could say that it feels no different to being 7 years&rsquo; old.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>From a process point of view, it's actually quite astounding to understand why it's all a distant memory to me.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>For starters, I&rsquo;m obviously not watching porn.</Text>

<Text>But let&rsquo;s really dig into what this actually means, because being a porn addict is so much more than just &lsquo;watching porn&rsquo; and turning into a pile of inconspicuous jelly.</Text>

<Text>From a time perspective, I&rsquo;m no longer spending hours everyday looking at porn.</Text>

<Text>Which not only means physically watching porn, but also dedicating time to watch porn which could otherwise be spent on more productive pursuits.</Text>

<Text>Another aspect which people don&rsquo;t consider is the mental overhead of planning and organising that time as well.</Text>

<Text>In my case, it meant consciously thinking about how I could masturbate to porn without my partner knowing, which not only affected my behaviour around her, but my mood as well if I hadn&rsquo;t orgasmed in a while.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>At it's worst, it was completely controlling my behaviour to a point of absolute obsession.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>There were times where I used to even do it at work, because I&rsquo;d had a bad day or I was feeling particularly desperate.</Text>

<Text>I remember when I was working in a very confined office, I went as far as to walk to the local library so I could use my laptop and get a better image, rather than with my phone which I could afford to sneak into the toilet.</Text>

<Text>You know, much like when I was absolutely obsessed with video games as a 7 year old, to a point where I would cry if my mother didn&rsquo;t let me play.</Text>

<Text>Of course, it&rsquo;s funny to look back at these memories and certainly, as awkward as it is to admit some of these things, because I haven&rsquo;t relived these behaviours in such a long time, it no longer affects me personally.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Certainly, the biggest thing that's changed is my mental state.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>The behaviours that arose from porn addiction aside, the thing which I&rsquo;ve noticed most is the improvement in my energy and mental state.</Text>

<Text>You know that post-relapse dopamine brain-fog fun-land of hell?</Text>

<Text>Well, that&rsquo;s truly a thing of the past and my mind is in a constant state of being level and clear, especially with my daily routine of meditation help balance things out.</Text>

<Text>I&rsquo;m no longer irrationally depressed and my emotions are no longer tipping up and down, like a bunch of ADHD kids on a see-saw.</Text>

<Text>But wow, what a difference.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>I distinctly remember that feeling of calm I felt when I first started meditating.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>It was mind-boggling. It was like I&rsquo;d finally felt peace and control for the first time in my porn recovery journey.</Text>

<Text>It was at that point that I knew I would never be addicted to porn again, because I&rsquo;d finally discovered a way to effortlessly tame my mind.</Text>

<Text>And that&rsquo;s another thing which a lot of people don&rsquo;t realise: When you overcome your porn addiction, life actually becomes easy and enjoyable.</Text>

<Text>Because your emotions aren&rsquo;t all over the place, it becomes really easy to commit to your goals, and an amazing side effect of this is that you actually become happy.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Like, not obsessive happy or manic happy, but just genuinely happy.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>The kind of happiness that doesn&rsquo;t ask anything of you, and which makes you feel completely at peace with yourself.</Text>

<Text>While it&rsquo;s been a long and arduous journey getting to this point, I can definitely say that once you experience all these wonderful things, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back.</Text>

<Text>Of course, the hard part is getting to a point where you finally do feel this kind of peace, which is why we emphasise the importance of practice and consistency.</Text>

<Text>As long as you stick with the process, you will absolutely succeed with your goal of overcoming porn addiction.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s also part of the reason why I&rsquo;ve put so much effort into crafting this website so that the process can make intuitive sense to you.</Text>

<Text>I know you can do it.</Text>
