<Text>This exercise is incredibly effective, especially for those new to awareness.</Text>

<Text>I mean, I&rsquo;d go as far as to say that all exercises are effective. It&rsquo;s just that some exercises a lot simpler to execute than others.</Text>

<Text>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice as you trawl this website, is that there are a range of different exercises which all seem quite similar to each other.</Text>

<Text>This includes Slow Down Time where we attempt to slow down and speed up reality, as well as Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing where we attempt to shut down our mind completely, as if we&rsquo;ve consciously flicked off a switch at the back of our minds.</Text>

<Text>The idea is that with different perspectives, we can learn to understand ourselves and our conscious experience with a more open mind, as well as embrace different ways of thinking.</Text>

<Text>So that we can effectively challenge the denial that comes with being an addict.</Text>

<Text>With <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Relax Everything</Text>, what we&rsquo;re essentially trying to do is learn to relax and let go, as opposed to say, consciously manipulate our interpretation of reality or make judgements about how we&rsquo;re feeling.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s a skill which will allow us to effectively deal with our urges and uncomfortable feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>An important thing to keep in mind with these awareness exercises is that while we&rsquo;re ultimately aiming to develop hard skills, it&rsquo;s also important for us to focus on the introspection aspect of these exercises as well.</Text>

<Text>In other words, how these different exercises make us feel as we practice them.</Text>

<Text>From an introspection point of view, we&rsquo;re not necessarily trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything per-say.</Text>

<Text>Instead, what we&rsquo;re merely attempting to do is observe and develop our ability to view ourselves with a more open mind.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a very effective way to learn mastery over your thoughts and emotions.</Text>

<Text>So whenever you&rsquo;re doing these kinds of exercises, remember to always try and guage how you feel. Does the exercise make you feel frustrated? Do you think anything at all?</Text>

<h4>If you skip this step, then you'll gain very little from these exercises because you won't be actively engaging your brain.</h4>

<Text>And if you don&rsquo;t engage your brain, then you won&rsquo;t engage in physical changes that take place between your neural connections, and subscequently you won&rsquo;t be truly changing in the sense of conscious realisation.</Text>

<Text>So ask yourself when doing the exercise:</Text>

<Text>Do you feel more comfortable when you relax? Is there anything you don&rsquo;t like about relaxing? How does it compare to other awareness exercises? Do you even understand what it means to be relaxed at all?</Text>

<Text>Remember, this is a process of self-discovery.</Text>

<Text>There are no right or wrong answers.</Text>

<Text>There is only what you feel and how you perceive.</Text>

<Text>For this exercise, what we want to do is relax and you can do this whenever you want.</Text>

<Text>I personally find it&rsquo;s quite effective to engage in this activity while doing something, because it&rsquo;s arguably easier to relax when you&rsquo;re in a non-relaxed state, as opposed to sitting silently in a chair.</Text>

<Text>So what does it mean to relax?</Text>

<Text>Well, let&rsquo;s start with some of the physical attributes.</Text>

<Text>Relaxing from a physical perspective means letting go of all the tension in your body. It means slowing your mental pace, as well as taking things easy.</Text>

<Text>If I had to describe the essence of relaxation, I would say that it&rsquo;s about experiencing life without obligation or care. You just are.</Text>

<Text>It means not worrying about anything, because you know what? There&rsquo;s simply no obligation to worry, because when you are relaxed you have no responsibilty to anything.</Text>

<Text>Again, I urge you to remember that this is a process of self-discovery, and that I&rsquo;m not asking you to permanently dissolve into a puddle of jelly.</Text>

<Text>These are short bursts of perspective I am asking you to engage in throughout the day, in order to develop a more open mind.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, while I can describe what relaxation is all day, unless if you actually attempt to practice it, then you simply won&rsquo;t learn what it actually is, nor be able to effectively use it when required.</Text>

<Text>One key thing to understand about relaxation is that it&rsquo;s a feeling, so if you can&rsquo;t feel it on demand, then you won&rsquo;t be able to cope when you find yourself in a situation where you feel compelled to watch porn or do something equally self-destructive.</Text>

<Text>In other words, relaxation is one of the many health coping mechanisms we will be developing in order to help us cope with life in a more effective way.</Text>
