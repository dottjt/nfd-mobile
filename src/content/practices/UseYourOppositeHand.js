          <Text>This exercise is a great way to force yourself out of your comfort zone.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, the idea behind this exercise is to force limitation upon ourselves and gauge not only how we respond, but how we can better react inspite of our circumstances.</Text>

<Text>As I&rsquo;ve written about extensively, part of what makes NeverFap Deluxe effective is learning to respond effectively in the face of adversity.</Text>

<Text>It can be easy to get frustrated when we&rsquo;re forced to slow down, or even do something which we&rsquo;re entirely unfamiliar with, but the key thing to understand here is that when we do get frustrated we&rsquo;re essentially fighting with ourselves.</Text>

<Text>Which is to say that these &ldquo;limitations&rdquo; are merely perceptions or expectations we have based in the belief that we deserve better.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s important that we learn to dissolve these expectations in order to learn to live without these self-percieved limitations.</Text>

<Text>Not only because they&rsquo;re not real, but also because they truly hinder us in the sense that they do not empower us in any way.</Text>

<Text>What happens if we get hit by a car and we&rsquo;re no longer able to walk again? What if something does truly happen to our dominant hand and we&rsquo;re no longer able to use it?</Text>

<Text>This also extends to situations in life which are simply out of our control. It could be the death of a family member. It could be the loss of your job.</Text>

<Text>And things which due to our beliefs, can cause us to derail and end in self-harm if we choose to react inappropriately i.e. masturbate to porn.</Text>

<Text>Rather, what&rsquo;s important is that we learn to remain calm and relaxed inspite of what we&rsquo;re experiencing, both with and without limitations.</Text>

<Text>In other words, this exercise can be thought of as a test to train us to deal with difficult situations.</Text>

<Text>As well as help us better appreciate the difficulty of unfamiliarity of being limited in some way, not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to learn, develop and grow as individuals.</Text>

<Text>For this exercise what we essentially want to do is utilise our less-dominant hand to complete everyday tasks.</Text>

<Text>It could be brushing your teeth. It could be washing the dishes. It could be writing. It could be using your phone.</Text>

<Text>It could be any number of things and I want you to take note of a few things which will help you get the most out of this exercise.</Text>

<Text>For starters, I want you to notice the physical feeling of using your non-dominant hand. What does it feel like to use your other hand in ways you&rsquo;ve probably never used before?</Text>

<Text>Does it feel unnatural? Does it feel slightly unreal? Is the task just as easy to complete with your non-dominant hand? In what ways does it feel similar? It what ways do you have less control?</Text>

<Text>Next, I want you to focus on how it makes you feel emotionally.</Text>

<Text>Do you feel any less capable as a human being? Does it make you feel &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;? Does it make you feel graitude or frustration? Do you feel as if you want to blame yourself?</Text>

<Text>As always, there are no right or wrong answers when practicing these kinds of exercises. These exercises are merely designed to gauge your response in regards to a complete change of pace.</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to you how you choose to respond.</Text>

<Text>They exist to help you become aware of your thoughts, actions and behaviours, so you can decide to consciously change or replace them if you so desire.</Text>

<Text>Otherwise, nothing will change and you will continue to repeat the same behaviours time and time again.</Text>

<Text>Open your mind and the rest will follow.</Text>
