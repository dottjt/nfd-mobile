<Text>A lot of people find this exercise super useful, because it can help us identify our biases much easier than trying to identify those biases directly.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s a great thinking exercise, which makes you realise how well optimised our minds truly are when it comes to filtering information.</Text>

<Text>Judgement by function is conditional.</Text>

<Text>We discover some sort of condition which triggers us to react, either negatively or positively.</Text>

<Text>For a lot of people, these triggers are aspects of their personality they&rsquo;re completely unaware of.</Text>

<Text>Most judgemental people don&rsquo;t even realise they&rsquo;re judgemental, because it&rsquo;s such an ingrained aspect of who they are, that they assume it&rsquo;s all just some continuum of everyday thought.</Text>

<Text>In these situations, it can be very difficult to actually identify what is judgement and what is not.</Text>

<Text>And so the purpose of this exercise is to help you make that distinction, by bringing to your attention the things which you don&rsquo;t feel compelled to be judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>Which for a lot people, is a lot simpler than trying to identify the things which they feel passionately judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>In addition, it can help them understand more about themselves, by merely identifying the things which they don&rsquo;t care about.</Text>

<Text>The exercise is simple.</Text>

<Text>Your task is to think about the things you don&rsquo;t feel judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>Things which you couldn&rsquo;t possibly care about, which don&rsquo;t evoke any kind of reaction.</Text>

<Text>Then once you&rsquo;ve identified that thing, ask yourself why? Why doesn&rsquo;t that particular subject evoke a feeling?</Text>

<Text>Why are you not attached to that particular subject?</Text>

<Text>For example, I&rsquo;m not judgemental about medical surgeons. I have literally zero opinion on medical surgeons.</Text>

<Text>Why? Well, I guess because I don&rsquo;t actually know any medical surgeons, and it&rsquo;s simply not a subject which ever enters my conscious.</Text>

<Text>The key with this exercise is to progressively try to find subjects which you&rsquo;re not judgemental about, yet may be related to or have something in common with the things you are judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>For example, you may feel judgemental about celebrities or politicians, but feel significantly less judgement about popular sporting figures.</Text>

<Text>Try and discover some common themes. Perhaps you might discover something. Perhaps you might not.</Text>

<Text>We&rsquo;re all here to learn more about how our individual minds work.</Text>
