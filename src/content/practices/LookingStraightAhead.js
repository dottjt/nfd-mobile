<Text style={p}>This exercise is truly extraordinary and it&rsquo;s an exercise I try to practice as much as I can when I&rsquo;m out in public.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The premise behind it is simple, however it&rsquo;s an exercise that a lot of people struggle with.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially with this exercise what we want to do is to always look straight ahead without turning our heads unnecessarily.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Part of the problem when our focus and attention is weak, or even if we&rsquo;ve never bother to question otherwise, is that we can find ourselves procrastinating or getting distracted easily.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this can often be noticed in full-force when we&rsquo;re out in public.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Without proper focus, we can find ourselves staring unnecessarily at every person we walk by (often, to try and seek attractive men/women) or perhaps it might even be looking into the windows of shops.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, today we&rsquo;re going to do something about that, and we&rsquo;re going to consciously refraing from staring at others in public.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is an amazing exercise, especially in regards to developing control over our focus and attention, and by learning to ignore other people in public, you can learn to focus on what&rsquo;s truly important.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Yourself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not to mention, humans usually function better when they have a clear goal in mind, and this exercise has been designed to teach you how to focus on your goals in a very simple way.</Text>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>What you&rsquo;ll want to do is stare straight ahead while you&rsquo;re walking in public (obviously common sense applies here, don&rsquo;t cross the road while doing this etc.)</Text>

<Text style={p}>Focus your vision and attention right in front of you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As weird as it sounds, it can even help to think or yourself as a train on rails, which can only move in one direction and which doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to even turn left or right.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The aim of this exercise is to learn not to stare at others, nor have your attention hooked in any way by anything in particular, whether that be people, nature or even store-fronts.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Often what I find helps is if you try and look above people&rsquo;s heads into the far distance, so that even though there may be people in front of them, you&rsquo;re technically not looking at them persay.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, find what personally works for you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Often what happens, especially if you&rsquo;re a porn addict, is that you&rsquo;ll intentionally go and search around in public looking for attractive people, which merely reinforces our porn addiction and doesn&rsquo;t help us develop control over our minds.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With this exercise, we&rsquo;re going to train ourselves not to do this, by having a higher principle in mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rather than search around, we are instead going to be focus on the journey and our destination instead.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, this exercise works best if you&rsquo;re in public where there are plenty of people, otherwise it can still work around the house, although to significantly less effect.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Just remember that no matter what, you are 100% in-control of your body and you determine where your eyes look.</Text>
