<Text>This exercise is designed to help dissolve your ego.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>In particular, by getting you actively reinterpret your visual field.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Before we commence however, we must first come to understand how humans interpret reality.</Text>

<Text>On a conceptual level, humans relate to the world with language. We use words and symbols in order to define and describe the world around us.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s what allows us to gauge social situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the relationship between ourselves and our environment.</Text>

<Text>And yet, although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on our conceptual understanding of the world.</Text>

<Text>None of it is actually &lsquo;real&rsquo;.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Numbers, for example, are not real. They're just mathematical descriptions.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>On a cultural level, this conceptuality extends to all the predefined rules we have in regards to how we should act and behave.</Text>

<Text>For example, some cultures prefer kissing as opposed to shaking hands as a way to greet others &hellip;and yet this preference doesn&rsquo;t actually help describe what humans are.</Text>

<Text>Although society attempts to define us based on our behaviours and how we act, it still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that we all have five fingers, two eyes and need to be loved.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>We're all still merely people, after all.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>By the same token, our addiction to porn maintains a very similar same layer of conceptual &lsquo;description&rsquo; which prevents us from truly seeing what we&rsquo;re actually doing.</Text>

<Text>For example, we can find ourselves drawn to certain types of porn or online fetishes.</Text>

<Text>Even though, when you think about it, it&rsquo;s all just a bunch of light emanating from our computer screens.</Text>

<Text>Which when you put it like that, makes porn addiction seem quite silly.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>I mean, is that arrangement of light and colour on your computer screen really that special enough for you to be completely dependent upon it?</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Essentially, what we intend to do with this exercise is help your brain distinguish between what you see (i.e. light and colour).</Text>

<Text>In contrast to that extra layer of conceptuality clouding your vision (i.e. the actual person standing in front of you).</Text>

<Text>We want to remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality, not only to see a &lsquo;clearer&rsquo; picture of reality, but to better understand what we&rsquo;re actually experiencing.</Text>

<Text>So really, what we&rsquo;re trying to discover is.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>What information do we lose with all this additional mental processing?</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Can we call what we even see with this additional processing &lsquo;reality&rsquo;?</Text>

<Text>Is it possible to truly &lsquo;see&rsquo; when our minds are in a constant state of evaluation?</Text>

<Text>These are the questions will be attempting to answer and of course, it can help to understand that there are many ways we cloud our vision with description.</Text>

<Text>For example, we typically use a variety of objects in our visual field to construct depth. Then, we often evaluate those objects. Are they alive? Are they human? Are they dangerous?</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, this is the process we are trying to understand.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour.</Text>

<Text>No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another. No intepretations.</Text>

<Text>Nuthin&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text>Instead, what we want to do is treat our visual field as a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.</Text>

<Text>It usually helps to imagine everything as a cloud of sensation, although I&rsquo;m sure there are other more meaningful ways to describe it.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, don&rsquo;t try to focus.</Text>

<Text>Keep your attention wide and merely feel as if you&rsquo;re intaking the visual information around you, rather than from the point of view of you actively perceiving that information.</Text>

<Text>While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a few minutes alone, where you can really explore this idea uninterupted.</Text>
