<Text>Learning to focus our attention is an important skill.</Text>

<Text>However, I would also argue that it&rsquo;s quite an advanced skill that should only be attempted once you feel more comfortable being aware in general.</Text>

<Text>In fact, it&rsquo;s an exercise which builds upon Observe Your Senses so it makes sense to master that first.</Text>

<Text>Otherwise, we can truly struggle with this exercise, and more often than not when people attempt to learn this exercise first, it almost always leads to more confusion than clarity.</Text>

<Text>So please do not proceed until you&rsquo;ve mastered more fundamental awareness exercises.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>What is focus?</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>The funny thing about focus is that it&rsquo;s a bit of a paradox, at least according to conventional wisdom.</Text>

<Text>A lot of people treat focus as if it&rsquo;s supposed to be this kind of intense period of concentration, which is designed to consume all you energy and attention.</Text>

<Text>In reality, effective focus is not like that and cannot come from tensing up and trying &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; to get into that mental zone.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Instead, effective focus comes from being calm and relaxed with a clear intention in mind.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure anyone could maintain intense focus by trying &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; however it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be effective in the sense of being in control.</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, you cannot focus effectively if you&rsquo;re spending all your mental energy on creating an environment in which you feel comfortable to focus.</Text>

<Text>Because then you&rsquo;re left with significantly less energy to actually focus, and instead it leaves you incredibly vulnerable and quite ironically, without focus.</Text>

<Text>Definitely, not fun.</Text>

<Text>As stated earlier, if I had to describe what focus is.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>I would say that it's nothing more than awareness with a clear intention.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Which is to say that it&rsquo;s the same thing as being aware in the traditional sense (i.e. observation), only now you&rsquo;re choosing an intention outside of simply being aware of your senses.</Text>

<Text>This is why I say that you must first learn to master basic awareness before moving onto these kinds of exercises.</Text>

<Text>Because it actually requires more skill to remain calm and aware, while also selectively focusing on a certain aspect of your awareness.</Text>

<Text>Which people generally find more difficult than simply being aware of all their sense.</Text>

<Text>In essence, it&rsquo;s easier to be fully attuned to all your senses at once without focus, than it is to be fully attuned to just one of your senses</Text>

<Text>Simply because there&rsquo;s less overhead.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>There are essentially two key steps towards performing this exercise.</Text>

<Text>First, relax and put yourself into a state of unconditional awareness, as per the instructions in Observe Your Senses.</Text>

<Text>In this state of mind, you should have completely emptied your mind and become fully attuned to your senses.</Text>

<Text>Then, once you have achieved this, attempt to place your attention on a very particular aspect of your awareness.</Text>

<Text>It could be something visual, like a lamp or a door. It could be a sound that is occurring in the background. It could be a physical sensation that you&rsquo;re experiencing in your body.</Text>

<Text>Play around with it and see where your mind takes you.</Text>

<Text>This is an exercise which porn addicts benefit from greatly, due to the way it changes your visual perception of reality.</Text>

<Text>So let&rsquo;s get crackin&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text>The intention behind a lot of these exercises is to assist you in breaking down what you understand of your mind.</Text>

<Text>The word &ldquo;understand&rdquo; of course, meaning the conglomerate of knowledge you&rsquo;ve gained and learned up until now.</Text>

<Text>Part of the reason why we want to break down your understanding of life and reality, is because what you currently &ldquo;know&rdquo; is largely counter-intuitive.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>You see, what you "understand" is part of the reason why you're addicted to porn.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>What you currently &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is that you really want to watch porn.</Text>

<Text>What you &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is that you don&rsquo;t have the self-control not to watch porn, and that it&rsquo;s a lot easier if you just relapse and watch porn.</Text>

<Text>And certainly, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</Text>

<Text>I mean, it&rsquo;s what you understand. You can&rsquo;t help what you&rsquo;ve been taught up until now, it&rsquo;s all your brain knows.</Text>

<Text>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s also perfectly fine to change your understanding of reality so that you can allow yourself the opportunity to overcome your own porn addiction.</Text>

<Text>Which is exactly what this website aims to do.</Text>

<Text>For today&rsquo;s exercise, what we want to do is break down our visual understanding of reality, and how that relates to our own thoughts and feelings.</Text>

<Text>Which is to say that we want to separate our thoughts and feelings from what we&rsquo;re actually seeing in front of us.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>As human beings, we tend to attach meaning and value to that which we can physically see.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>It could be a trinket that belongs to your family which evokes emotions of pride and belonging.</Text>

<Text>It could be the sight of a McDonalds in the distance, and the memories that place evokes. It could even be something more conceptual, like a particular scene within a movie.</Text>

<Text>And with this exercise we want to learn to separate these two elements, because what we see is not what we feel.</Text>

<Text>They are two completely separate elements which we&rsquo;ve learnt to associate together, no different to watching porn and all the feelings associated with it.</Text>

<Text>Both empowering and overwhelmingly negative.</Text>

<Text>Think of them as being two completely different sensations. The sensation of seeing, and the sensation of feeling.</Text>

<Text>So why is this important?</Text>

<Text>Well, let&rsquo;s look at porn addiction for example.</Text>

<Text>For porn addicts porn isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;. Rather, it&rsquo;s a complex relationship which evokes a whole range of feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>Porn is also feeling immense guilt for having relapsed, porn is feeling completely empty and drained on the inside, porn is the shame of lying about our habit to our friends and family.</Text>

<Text>Yet when you think about it, porn really is nothing more than &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text>Sure, it&rsquo;s something that a lot of humans find destructively addictive, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny that from a visual perspective, there really is nothing that awful about it.</Text>

<Text>With this in mind, what this exercise attempts to do is help you come to the understand that porn is simply &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text>And the way we do this is by separating what we feel and what we see into two different categories.</Text>

<Text>Because currently we may have developed a habit of jumbling the two together, and not quite realising all the steps our mind makes internal when jumping to the conclusion of &ldquo;I really want to watch porn&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text>One thing to notice is that this exercise may seem incredibly similar to Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality.</Text>

<Text>Both exercises focus on manipulating our visual understanding in some way, however both exercises do completely different things.</Text>

<Text><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality</Text> attempts to completely absolve our understanding of reality, while this exercise attempts to rearrange our understanding of it.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise, what we want to do is look at some things, and try and figure out the difference between what we&rsquo;re seeing and what we&rsquo;re feeling.</Text>

<Text>We can do this sitting down at home, or anywhere really. Observe what you see. Observe what you feel.</Text>

<Text>It could be a building. It could be another person. I tend to do this exercise using everyday objects, although sentimental objects can work well too.</Text>

<Text>Especially objects that we&rsquo;ve kept around the house for a while, that you&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with. (for example, it could be a video game console)</Text>

<Text>Can you distinguish any difference between the object and the feeling? What are those differences? Is there even a difference?</Text>

<Text>Is there any feeling at all, and are you responsible for creating that feeling or is it the object which is responsible for how you feel</Text>

<Text>Play around with it.</Text>

<Text>Try this exercises in different areas and different places. See if you can discover any common themes.</Text>

<Text>The world truly is your oyster ^^</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Slow Down Time</Text>
        

<Text>This exercise is one of the easiest ways to start building your awareness.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Essentially, it involves slowing down your mind so that you can open yourself to the opportunity of being aware.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>One of the most common ways we weaken our ability to be aware is by losing control over our thoughts.</Text>

<Text>And the reason why we lose control over our thoughts is because they can be almost impossible to track when they&rsquo;re zooming around in our head at a million miles per hour.</Text>

<Text>In other words, because we&rsquo;re overthinking.</Text>

<Text>In most cases we don&rsquo;t even realise we&rsquo;re overthinking, because we&rsquo;re so consumed by our thoughts that we don&rsquo;t even allow ourselves the opportunity to realise what&rsquo;s going on.</Text>

<Text>Which over time can form into an instinctual reaction towards dealing with our negative feelings and emotions.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Certainly, for most people, porn addiction is merely a subconscious response.</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>And this exercise is designed to help break that cycle.</Text>

<Text>Rather than attempt to identify and qualify these thoughts, what we&rsquo;re going to do is simply going to focus on the raw process and sensation of thinking.</Text>

<Text>And in doing so, embrace the physical sensation of what it actually feels like to be in control of our minds, in order to create a strong foundation for being able to control what we think and feel.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Because when we're in control of our mind, it's almost as if everything is moving in slow motion.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>The key thing to understand about maintaining control over our minds is that isn&rsquo;t necessarily about being able to react to what&rsquo;s in front of us.</Text>

<Text>Instead, a large part of maintaining control is about being able to prepare ourselves mentally for the events that will take place in the future.</Text>

<Text>The idea being that we can then catch ourselves before we begin overthinking, and identify these patterns before they become unmanagable.</Text>

<Text>Because when our mind is racing at a million miles per hour, it can become incredibly difficult, if not impossible to slow it down.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>Which is why people inevitably relapse.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>Because at that point, you&rsquo;ve already lost control.</Text>

<Text>By practicing <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Slow it down</Text> you will learn how to slow down your mind on a regular basis.</Text>

<Text>In order to demonstrate control, and create those neural connections in your brain.</Text>

<Text>In addition, it will help you understand how to become a more calm and collected person, exposing in the process the futility and self-destructiveness of letting our thoughts control us.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>When you have a moment, just slow down your mind.</Text>

<Text>This tends to work best when you&rsquo;re in the middle of doing something, because that&rsquo;s usually when your mind is engaged and requires relaxation.</Text>

<Text>Keep in mind that there are two different aspects to this exercise:
Mental and physical.</Text>

<Text>For example, when I&rsquo;m walking down the street, aside from slowing down my thoughts, I will also sometimes physically slow down, even stopping where I stand.</Text>

<Text>The idea is to prove control over yourself, even when you have other intentions, such as getting to a destination on time.</Text>

<Text>An idea that will prove very important in following exercises.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing</Text>
        



<Text>I love this exercise.</Text>

<Text>I can&rsquo;t quite tell if this exercise is an analogue to Slow Down Your Perception Of Time or a percursor to it, however they&rsquo;re both different approaches to the same concept of awareness.</Text>

<Text>Usually you&rsquo;ll end up using both in conjunction, but it&rsquo;s arguably easier to learn them as separate, unique skills.</Text>

<Text>All awareness exercises essentially come down to finding different ways to break down you perception of who you are.</Text>

<Text>And this is a very important practice because our perception of who we are, isn&rsquo;t actually who we are.</Text>

<Text>It is merely an identity we carry to help us navigate through life.</Text>

<Text>And when we don&rsquo;t realise this, or aren&rsquo;t consciously aware of this label that we prescribe to ourselves on a daily basis, then we can become ransom to this persona.</Text>

<Text>By learning to understand this identity, we provide ourselves with the opportunity to be able to directly control how we operate, without relying on the expectations of this persona.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>What this exercise attempts to do is help you better disassociate yourself from this persona.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>The end goal isn&rsquo;t necessarily to completely dissolve this persona.</Text>

<Text>(Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with dissolving it. It&rsquo;s simply impractical for most people, including myself)</Text>

<Text>However to have the capacity to be able to dissolve it at will, as well keep on top of it when it may be beginning to get out of hand is a wonderful skill to have.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, what this exercise teaches you is to learn to let go from a physical perspective in the sense of stopping your mind altogether.</Text>

<Text>I think you&rsquo;ll have fun with this one.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>This exercise generally only works while you&rsquo;re doing something.</Text>

<Text>You could be studying. You could be walking down the street in an attempt to get somewhere. Definitely don&rsquo;t do it mid-conversation.</Text>

<Text>However during that activity, what you want to do is turn off your mind completely.</Text>

<Text>Like, just shut it off.</Text>

<Text>It can help to pretend as if you&rsquo;re a robot that&rsquo;s just had it&rsquo;s power supply cut off.</Text>

<Text>One thing to keep in mind is that it&rsquo;s an exercice that&rsquo;s largely conceptual and based on feeling.</Text>

<Text>So really play around with the character and explore this idea of what it means to shut down like a robot on it&rsquo;s last legs.</Text>

<Text>What does shutting down entail? Are there any steps towards shutting down, or is it an instantaneous action?</Text>

<Text>What does it feel like to be shut down? Can you feel at all once you&rsquo;ve shut down?</Text>

<Text>When you&rsquo;ve shut down do you feel relaxed or tense? Is this a reflection on your own ability to relax at will?</Text>

<Text>Play with it and see where it takes you.</Text>

<Text>&hellip;and obviously don&rsquo;t do this while crossing a road.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Observe Your Senses</Text>
        



<Text>This exercise encompasses one of the most fundamental skills in regards to practicing meditation.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>Your ability to remain aware of your senses in the present moment.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>It&rsquo;s a skill which will form the foundation of almost all the practices on this website, in particular the introspection aspect of these practices i.e. how these exercises make you feel as you practice them.</Text>

<Text>The interesting thing about this exercise is that despite the inherent simplicity of what it is, it&rsquo;s an exercise most people struggle with.</Text>

<Text>In part, because of the great amount of misunderstanding and confusion surrounding what &lsquo;observation&rsquo; truly is.</Text>

<Text>And this happens for a number of reasons.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>For starters, we severely overcomplicate what it is, thinking it must be so much more than simply paying attention to what we're feeling.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Instead, we develop this idea that it must be this highly-trained skill that only Bhuddist monks can attain following years of practice in a remote location.</Text>

<Text>So what ends up happening is put all this effort and strain into trying to develop this &lsquo;zen-like&rsquo; state of mind, which ends up exhausting us more than it does helping us.</Text>

<Text>We become so distracted in the expectation of what observation should be, that we ironically spend all our mental effort judging and feeling pressured, rather than observing at all.</Text>

<Text>So let&rsquo;s change that.</Text>

<Text>To put it into the most simple terms I know how.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Observation is nothing more than paying attention to your senses.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>If you&rsquo;re at a cafe for example, it means paying attention to the sounds of the people chatting around you, what the atmosphere around you smells like etc.</Text>

<Text>Because when you think about it, you&rsquo;re already observing reality.</Text>

<Text>You&rsquo;re already breathing. You&rsquo;re already blinking. You&rsquo;re already seeing.</Text>

<Text>You simply haven&rsquo;t applied that extra step of making yourself aware of all those things which you are currently doing.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s literally that simple.</Text>

<Text>You don&rsquo;t need to attempt to find something that&rsquo;s not there, nor even manipulate your interpretation of what you&rsquo;re feeling or thinking via thought or judgement.</Text>

<Text>Instead, it&rsquo;s about noticing your surroundings, thoughts and feelings, in addition to any particular reactions you may be having to those aspects of your reality. Hell, perhaps you&rsquo;re not even thinking or feeling at all?</Text>

<Text>That&rsquo;s for you to discover.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>Where I personally feel a lot of people explaining observation go wrong, is that they focus on this whole "really try to empty your thoughts" or "attempt to refrain from judgement" mindset.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>Because it essentially implies that you have to do &ldquo;more&rdquo; to somehow achieve what is effectively an empty state of mind.</Text>

<Text>Which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, and is even contradictory.</Text>

<Text>You don&rsquo;t have to change anything. Observation isn&rsquo;t about changing anything or setting expectations. It&rsquo;s the exact opposite of that.</Text>

<Text>Instead, it&rsquo;s about observing what you&rsquo;re currently sensing via your thoughts and emotions.</Text>

<Text>So don&rsquo;t worry about trying to prevent your thoughts, or getting frustrating if you can&rsquo;t stop thinking.</Text>

<Text>That&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to address, and the way we do that is by focusing on the task at hand, which is observation itself.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>Another important thing to keep in mind is that we're not necessarily attempting to 'achieve' anything with observation.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>Instead, what we&rsquo;re doing is exploring.</Text>

<Text>We&rsquo;re exploring how we feel, how we think, as well as discovering what we personally find enjoyable and empowering.</Text>

<Text>So that we can better understand ourselves.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>This exercise is outrageously simple.</Text>

<Text>Observe your senses.</Text>

<Text>Observe what you&rsquo;re feeling. Observe what you&rsquo;re thinking. Observe what&rsquo;s around you.</Text>

<Text>The world is your oyster.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>Observe all the various interactions that are taking place in your mind.</h4>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text>It&rsquo;s about sitting there (or standing, or walking, or whatever you happen to be doing) and paying attention to what you&rsquo;re sensing, whether it be thought, emotion or absolutely nothing at all.</Text>

<Text>And remember, you&rsquo;re not attempting to change anything here. Instead you&rsquo;re merely keeping note and acknowledging the cloud of sensation that is your reality.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, you may struggle with it initially.</Text>

<Text>Which is to say that you may not be used to simply observing, and instead be in a constant state of reaction and judgement.</Text>

<Text>That&rsquo;s okay too. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re practicing this exercise, so we can improve and develop these skills.</Text>

<Text>So don&rsquo;t be alarmed if you find observation to be difficult.</Text>

<Text>There&rsquo;s always a first for everything.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Dissolve Your Visual Field</Text>
        

<Text>This exercise is designed to help dissolve your ego.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>In particular, by getting you actively reinterpret your visual field.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Before we commence however, we must first come to understand how humans interpret reality.</Text>

<Text>On a conceptual level, humans relate to the world with language. We use words and symbols in order to define and describe the world around us.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s what allows us to gauge social situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the relationship between ourselves and our environment.</Text>

<Text>And yet, although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on our conceptual understanding of the world.</Text>

<Text>None of it is actually &lsquo;real&rsquo;.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Numbers, for example, are not real. They're just mathematical descriptions.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>On a cultural level, this conceptuality extends to all the predefined rules we have in regards to how we should act and behave.</Text>

<Text>For example, some cultures prefer kissing as opposed to shaking hands as a way to greet others &hellip;and yet this preference doesn&rsquo;t actually help describe what humans are.</Text>

<Text>Although society attempts to define us based on our behaviours and how we act, it still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that we all have five fingers, two eyes and need to be loved.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>We're all still merely people, after all.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>By the same token, our addiction to porn maintains a very similar same layer of conceptual &lsquo;description&rsquo; which prevents us from truly seeing what we&rsquo;re actually doing.</Text>

<Text>For example, we can find ourselves drawn to certain types of porn or online fetishes.</Text>

<Text>Even though, when you think about it, it&rsquo;s all just a bunch of light emanating from our computer screens.</Text>

<Text>Which when you put it like that, makes porn addiction seem quite silly.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>I mean, is that arrangement of light and colour on your computer screen really that special enough for you to be completely dependent upon it?</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Essentially, what we intend to do with this exercise is help your brain distinguish between what you see (i.e. light and colour).</Text>

<Text>In contrast to that extra layer of conceptuality clouding your vision (i.e. the actual person standing in front of you).</Text>

<Text>We want to remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality, not only to see a &lsquo;clearer&rsquo; picture of reality, but to better understand what we&rsquo;re actually experiencing.</Text>

<Text>So really, what we&rsquo;re trying to discover is.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>What information do we lose with all this additional mental processing?</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Can we call what we even see with this additional processing &lsquo;reality&rsquo;?</Text>

<Text>Is it possible to truly &lsquo;see&rsquo; when our minds are in a constant state of evaluation?</Text>

<Text>These are the questions will be attempting to answer and of course, it can help to understand that there are many ways we cloud our vision with description.</Text>

<Text>For example, we typically use a variety of objects in our visual field to construct depth. Then, we often evaluate those objects. Are they alive? Are they human? Are they dangerous?</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, this is the process we are trying to understand.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour.</Text>

<Text>No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another. No intepretations.</Text>

<Text>Nuthin&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text>Instead, what we want to do is treat our visual field as a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.</Text>

<Text>It usually helps to imagine everything as a cloud of sensation, although I&rsquo;m sure there are other more meaningful ways to describe it.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, don&rsquo;t try to focus.</Text>

<Text>Keep your attention wide and merely feel as if you&rsquo;re intaking the visual information around you, rather than from the point of view of you actively perceiving that information.</Text>

<Text>While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a few minutes alone, where you can really explore this idea uninterupted.</Text>

<Text>This exercise is incredibly effective, especially for those new to awareness.</Text>

<Text>I mean, I&rsquo;d go as far as to say that all exercises are effective. It&rsquo;s just that some exercises a lot simpler to execute than others.</Text>

<Text>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice as you trawl this website, is that there are a range of different exercises which all seem quite similar to each other.</Text>

<Text>This includes Slow Down Time where we attempt to slow down and speed up reality, as well as Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing where we attempt to shut down our mind completely, as if we&rsquo;ve consciously flicked off a switch at the back of our minds.</Text>

<Text>The idea is that with different perspectives, we can learn to understand ourselves and our conscious experience with a more open mind, as well as embrace different ways of thinking.</Text>

<Text>So that we can effectively challenge the denial that comes with being an addict.</Text>

<Text>With <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Relax Everything</Text>, what we&rsquo;re essentially trying to do is learn to relax and let go, as opposed to say, consciously manipulate our interpretation of reality or make judgements about how we&rsquo;re feeling.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s a skill which will allow us to effectively deal with our urges and uncomfortable feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>An important thing to keep in mind with these awareness exercises is that while we&rsquo;re ultimately aiming to develop hard skills, it&rsquo;s also important for us to focus on the introspection aspect of these exercises as well.</Text>

<Text>In other words, how these different exercises make us feel as we practice them.</Text>

<Text>From an introspection point of view, we&rsquo;re not necessarily trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything per-say.</Text>

<Text>Instead, what we&rsquo;re merely attempting to do is observe and develop our ability to view ourselves with a more open mind.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a very effective way to learn mastery over your thoughts and emotions.</Text>

<Text>So whenever you&rsquo;re doing these kinds of exercises, remember to always try and guage how you feel. Does the exercise make you feel frustrated? Do you think anything at all?</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<h4>If you skip this step, then you'll gain very little from these exercises because you won't be actively engaging your brain.</h4>

<Text>And if you don&rsquo;t engage your brain, then you won&rsquo;t engage in physical changes that take place between your neural connections, and subscequently you won&rsquo;t be truly changing in the sense of conscious realisation.</Text>

<Text>So ask yourself when doing the exercise:</Text>

<Text>Do you feel more comfortable when you relax? Is there anything you don&rsquo;t like about relaxing? How does it compare to other awareness exercises? Do you even understand what it means to be relaxed at all?</Text>

<Text>Remember, this is a process of self-discovery.</Text>

<Text>There are no right or wrong answers.</Text>

<Text>There is only what you feel and how you perceive.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise, what we want to do is relax and you can do this whenever you want.</Text>

<Text>I personally find it&rsquo;s quite effective to engage in this activity while doing something, because it&rsquo;s arguably easier to relax when you&rsquo;re in a non-relaxed state, as opposed to sitting silently in a chair.</Text>

<Text>So what does it mean to relax?</Text>

<Text>Well, let&rsquo;s start with some of the physical attributes.</Text>

<Text>Relaxing from a physical perspective means letting go of all the tension in your body. It means slowing your mental pace, as well as taking things easy.</Text>

<Text>If I had to describe the essence of relaxation, I would say that it&rsquo;s about experiencing life without obligation or care. You just are.</Text>

<Text>It means not worrying about anything, because you know what? There&rsquo;s simply no obligation to worry, because when you are relaxed you have no responsibilty to anything.</Text>

<Text>Again, I urge you to remember that this is a process of self-discovery, and that I&rsquo;m not asking you to permanently dissolve into a puddle of jelly.</Text>

<Text>These are short bursts of perspective I am asking you to engage in throughout the day, in order to develop a more open mind.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, while I can describe what relaxation is all day, unless if you actually attempt to practice it, then you simply won&rsquo;t learn what it actually is, nor be able to effectively use it when required.</Text>

<Text>One key thing to understand about relaxation is that it&rsquo;s a feeling, so if you can&rsquo;t feel it on demand, then you won&rsquo;t be able to cope when you find yourself in a situation where you feel compelled to watch porn or do something equally self-destructive.</Text>

<Text>In other words, relaxation is one of the many health coping mechanisms we will be developing in order to help us cope with life in a more effective way.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Catching The Odd Judge Out</Text>
        

<Text>A lot of people find this exercise super useful, because it can help us identify our biases much easier than trying to identify those biases directly.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s a great thinking exercise, which makes you realise how well optimised our minds truly are when it comes to filtering information.</Text>

<Text>Judgement by function is conditional.</Text>

<Text>We discover some sort of condition which triggers us to react, either negatively or positively.</Text>

<Text>For a lot of people, these triggers are aspects of their personality they&rsquo;re completely unaware of.</Text>

<Text>Most judgemental people don&rsquo;t even realise they&rsquo;re judgemental, because it&rsquo;s such an ingrained aspect of who they are, that they assume it&rsquo;s all just some continuum of everyday thought.</Text>

<Text>In these situations, it can be very difficult to actually identify what is judgement and what is not.</Text>

<Text>And so the purpose of this exercise is to help you make that distinction, by bringing to your attention the things which you don&rsquo;t feel compelled to be judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>Which for a lot people, is a lot simpler than trying to identify the things which they feel passionately judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>In addition, it can help them understand more about themselves, by merely identifying the things which they don&rsquo;t care about.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>The exercise is simple.</Text>

<Text>Your task is to think about the things you don&rsquo;t feel judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>Things which you couldn&rsquo;t possibly care about, which don&rsquo;t evoke any kind of reaction.</Text>

<Text>Then once you&rsquo;ve identified that thing, ask yourself why? Why doesn&rsquo;t that particular subject evoke a feeling?</Text>

<Text>Why are you not attached to that particular subject?</Text>

<Text>For example, I&rsquo;m not judgemental about medical surgeons. I have literally zero opinion on medical surgeons.</Text>

<Text>Why? Well, I guess because I don&rsquo;t actually know any medical surgeons, and it&rsquo;s simply not a subject which ever enters my conscious.</Text>

<Text>The key with this exercise is to progressively try to find subjects which you&rsquo;re not judgemental about, yet may be related to or have something in common with the things you are judgemental about.</Text>

<Text>For example, you may feel judgemental about celebrities or politicians, but feel significantly less judgement about popular sporting figures.</Text>

<Text>Try and discover some common themes. Perhaps you might discover something. Perhaps you might not.</Text>

<Text>We&rsquo;re all here to learn more about how our individual minds work.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Identify Points Of Awareness Throughout Your Day</Text>
        

<Text>This exercise is designed to help you keep on top of your awareness throughout the day.</Text>

<Text>By becoming more conscious of the events throughout our day, we can become more conscious of the things we do within it.</Text>

<Text>With this exercise, what we&rsquo;re attempting to do is become conscious of key moments throughout our day.</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<ul>
<li><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we wake up.</Text></li>
<li><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we shower.</Text></li>
<li><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we travel to work.</Text></li>
<li><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>During our lunch break.</Text></li>
<li><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>At dinner.</Text></li>
<li><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Before bed.</Text></li>
</ul>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text>The key thing to understand about awareness is that we&rsquo;re not actually aware unless if we exercise it.</Text>

<Text>Largely, most of us do all of the things mentioned above, without truly being aware that they&rsquo;re actually happening.</Text>

<Text>I mean, how many times have you consciously thought about something from the very moment you&rsquo;ve woken up?</Text>

<Text>You know, about a giraffe or that you&rsquo;re well and alive with two wonderful eyes?</Text>

<Text>Chances are those thoughts have simply never occurred to you, because instead, you go into autopilot mode where you just follow the motions.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>For this exercise, we want to do is start engaging our brain so that we can have those thoughts at these key moments throughout the day.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>The idea is that once we become more conscious of what&rsquo;s happening throughout our day, it can become a lot easier to detect and stop negative habits from reoccurring.</Text>

<Text>In particular, to better address our cravings, as well as those moments associated to our addiction where we feel as if we are not in control.</Text>

<Text>And despite this exercise being relatively straight forward, it&rsquo;s an exercise that a lot of people struggle with, because it&rsquo;s a completely different way of engaging with the world.</Text>

<Text>Becoming aware is not easy when you haven&rsquo;t consciously made an effort in the past to be aware before.</Text>

<Text>Of course, practice makes perfect.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>Essentially this is an exercise of acknowledgement.</Text>

<Text>Throughout your day, simply acknowledge what&rsquo;s taking place at that time.</Text>

<Text>For more specificity, you can identify the location, time and what exactly you&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 7am and I&rsquo;m currently brushing my teeth in the bathroom.&rdquo;</Text>

<Text>At this point, I want you to focus on how you feel.</Text>

<Text>Are you feeling tired? Are you feeling neutral? Are you feeling angry?</Text>

<Text>Regardless of how you feel, the idea is to get you to think about these events and how they relate to your emotions.</Text>

<Text>The other reason behind doing this, is that by identifying how you feel, it actually allows you to dissociate from your emotions and not take them personally.</Text>

<Text>Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to think about. It simply comes naturally.</Text>

<Text>The end goal here, aside from engaging your awareness, is to acknowledge and not react emotionally.</Text>

<Text>Because the more you do this, the more you know ahead of time how you will feel, and progressively overtime you will simply feel neutral at these particular time triggers throughout your day.</Text>

<Text>This is a truly fantastic exercise that I do everyday and it serves as an amazing anchor for my emotions.</Text>

<Text>You engage your awareness from the very moment you wake up, and it just gives you such a strong foothold over how you feel throughout the day.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Put Yourself In Other People's Shoes</Text>
        <Text>This exercise can be inherently difficult.</Text>

<Text>In large part because it demands you to think consciously beyond which you may feel comfortable.</Text>

<Text>In fact, half the reason why you&rsquo;re addicted to porn is because of all the subconscious behaviours you&rsquo;ve been constructing over the years, in order to deal with your own feelings of inadequacy etc.</Text>

<Text>Which meant putting your conscious awareness aside, which has now grown weak and must be retrained again from scratch.</Text>

<Text>With this exercise what we&rsquo;re going to attempt to do is to try and understand what it&rsquo;s like to be in the shoes of others.</Text>

<Text>And this kind of empathy is most prominent when we&rsquo;re watching documentaries based on humanitarian crisis or exploitation, where we get to see people struggle first-hand.</Text>

<Text>Certainly part of the reason why this is easy, as opposed to what you&rsquo;ll be attempting to do, is because you get to hear the stories of those people first-hand.</Text>

<Text>Instead of these people however, I want you to try and understand the people around you, whether that be your own friends and family, or even random strangers in public.</Text>

<Text>At the very least, to observe your own feelings of how you perceive others.</Text>

<Text>Now, although this may seem like an opportunity to judge, mock and possibly even condemn others, this truly isn&rsquo;t the purpose of the exercise.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, it comes down to two different thing:</Text>

<Text><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>How you genuinely feel about others from their own individual point of view.</Text></Text>

<Text><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Observing and questioning the validity of those feelings.</Text></Text>

<Text>And the benefits of this exercise are numerous.</Text>

<Text>Most prominently, attempting to try and understand others is an excellent way to uncover the extent to which we misunderstand ourselves.</Text>

<Text>Because if you&rsquo;re feeling particularly negative about someone (or possibly positive) then that usually reflects in how we see ourselves.</Text>

<Text>Which is to say that our empathy is often a reflection of our ability to judge and self-criticise.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise what we want to do is try and imagine what it&rsquo;s like to be others from their point of view.</Text>

<Text>This exercise works best when you&rsquo;re in public, usually sitting on public transport where you and the other person are both present.</Text>

<Text>Obviously, don&rsquo;t go crazy and stare at the other person, but I&rsquo;m sure you get the idea.</Text>

<Text>What can really help with this exercise is to first put all of your feelings and emotions aside, and just imagine a neutral version of yourself.</Text>

<Text>Then with this neutral version, imagine the other person being the same as well.</Text>

<Text>Starting with this blank slate can help immensely, because there&rsquo;s no point jumping to conclusions straight away.</Text>

<Text>Then once you&rsquo;re in that neutral mindset, you can begin to observe.</Text>

<Text>Does the other person look tense, or perhaps is it you who&rsquo;s actually tense?</Text>

<Text>Are they happy, sad or entirely neutral? Does it look like their mind is pre-occupied? How can you possibly know?</Text>

<Text>How do you personally feel doing this exercise? Do you find it difficult or easy?</Text>

<Text>In addition, also realise the extent to which you simply cannot be empathetic.</Text>

<Text>What aspects of a person can you not feel? Is it because they&rsquo;re aspects which you struggle to feel yourself?</Text>

<Text>Certainly, you may be surprised with what you discover.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Use Your Opposite Hand</Text>
        <Text>This exercise is a great way to force yourself out of your comfort zone.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, the idea behind this exercise is to force limitation upon ourselves and gauge not only how we respond, but how we can better react inspite of our circumstances.</Text>

<Text>As I&rsquo;ve written about extensively, part of what makes NeverFap Deluxe effective is learning to respond effectively in the face of adversity.</Text>

<Text>It can be easy to get frustrated when we&rsquo;re forced to slow down, or even do something which we&rsquo;re entirely unfamiliar with, but the key thing to understand here is that when we do get frustrated we&rsquo;re essentially fighting with ourselves.</Text>

<Text>Which is to say that these &ldquo;limitations&rdquo; are merely perceptions or expectations we have based in the belief that we deserve better.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s important that we learn to dissolve these expectations in order to learn to live without these self-percieved limitations.</Text>

<Text>Not only because they&rsquo;re not real, but also because they truly hinder us in the sense that they do not empower us in any way.</Text>

<Text>What happens if we get hit by a car and we&rsquo;re no longer able to walk again? What if something does truly happen to our dominant hand and we&rsquo;re no longer able to use it?</Text>

<Text>This also extends to situations in life which are simply out of our control. It could be the death of a family member. It could be the loss of your job.</Text>

<Text>And things which due to our beliefs, can cause us to derail and end in self-harm if we choose to react inappropriately i.e. masturbate to porn.</Text>

<Text>Rather, what&rsquo;s important is that we learn to remain calm and relaxed inspite of what we&rsquo;re experiencing, both with and without limitations.</Text>

<Text>In other words, this exercise can be thought of as a test to train us to deal with difficult situations.</Text>

<Text>As well as help us better appreciate the difficulty of unfamiliarity of being limited in some way, not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to learn, develop and grow as individuals.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise what we essentially want to do is utilise our less-dominant hand to complete everyday tasks.</Text>

<Text>It could be brushing your teeth. It could be washing the dishes. It could be writing. It could be using your phone.</Text>

<Text>It could be any number of things and I want you to take note of a few things which will help you get the most out of this exercise.</Text>

<Text>For starters, I want you to notice the physical feeling of using your non-dominant hand. What does it feel like to use your other hand in ways you&rsquo;ve probably never used before?</Text>

<Text>Does it feel unnatural? Does it feel slightly unreal? Is the task just as easy to complete with your non-dominant hand? In what ways does it feel similar? It what ways do you have less control?</Text>

<Text>Next, I want you to focus on how it makes you feel emotionally.</Text>

<Text>Do you feel any less capable as a human being? Does it make you feel &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;? Does it make you feel graitude or frustration? Do you feel as if you want to blame yourself?</Text>

<Text>As always, there are no right or wrong answers when practicing these kinds of exercises. These exercises are merely designed to gauge your response in regards to a complete change of pace.</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to you how you choose to respond.</Text>

<Text>They exist to help you become aware of your thoughts, actions and behaviours, so you can decide to consciously change or replace them if you so desire.</Text>

<Text>Otherwise, nothing will change and you will continue to repeat the same behaviours time and time again.</Text>

<Text>Open your mind and the rest will follow.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Where Do You Touch?</Text>
        <Text><b>Where Do You Touch?</b> is another classic awareness exercise which is designed to help you develop focus and attention.</Text>

<Text>By &ldquo;classic&rdquo; I mean it&rsquo;s another variation of the tried-and-true &ldquo;pay attention to X thing throughout the day&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen in abundance on this website.</Text>

<Text>Well, the reason why I write so many of them is because they&rsquo;re incredibly effective at getting you to think about awareness in a unique way.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>In essence, because this is what you should be doing with your attention anyway.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Which is to say that you should be practicing awareness in everything you do, and that this exercise is merely a shortcut to having you eventually do this automatically.</Text>

<Text>Awareness is important because it&rsquo;s what allows you to understand and learn your own behaviours, not only to change them, but also to enhance them.</Text>

<Text>By practicing awareness in any capacity, we train our ability to catch ourselves doing silly things, like watching porn when we&rsquo;re feeling stressed.</Text>

<Text>And instead, consciously decide within that moment, to replace that unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy coping mechanism instead.</Text>

<Text>The more we practice this, the more it will help us to think in terms of using our awareness in an empowering way, and eventually it will become second-nature to us.</Text>

<Text>Overtime we will become more aware of all our behaviours and quirks, and this is when we will develop full-control over our lives.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>In this exercise we&rsquo;re going to be paying attention to our body and how it interacts with touch.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, I want you to take note of whenever you&rsquo;re touching something.</Text>

<Text>For example, I&rsquo;m currently using my fingers to tap against this keyboard in order to type these words.</Text>

<Text>And yet although it&rsquo;s something I spend most my day doing, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve ever really thought about.</Text>

<Text>Well, that&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to address. To begin thinking about behaviours which your brain has subconsciously ignored for decades.</Text>

<Text>For example, your response to masturbate daily as a way to deal with certain feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>In addition, an important aspect of this exercise is to pay attention to the feeling of touch as well.</Text>

<Text>What does it feel like when you bump into something? Does it hurt when you touch something? Does it feel hot or cold? Does it evoke emotion?</Text>

<Text>Only by becoming aware of our senses can we not only learn to better understand how they relate to our conscious experience.</Text>

<Text>However it can help us to better control the experience itself once we become aware of our behaviours related to touch.</Text>

<Text>This is a great exercise in terms of being able to understand what it means to truly focus our minds and train our attention.</Text>

<Text>Part of the reason why many of us struggle with this idea of focus, is because many of us have this very rigid understanding of what focus is, as a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; state of mind that is attained in a very specific way.</Text>

<Text>Usually via intense meditation and awareness study, as well as an almost exquiste sense of self-control over our minds.</Text>

<Text>Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that it&rsquo;s quite the opposite.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>In actual fact, focus and attention are largely conceptual ideas which have no rigid implementation.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Which is to say that there is no one, nor necessarily correct way to obtain focus. And that all the limitations we perceive about our own ability to focus, are purely self-made.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, this isn&rsquo;t to say that you may not be struggling with developing focus.</Text>

<Text>However, it merely indicates that the perceived limitations we have in regards to our inability to focus can be solved with a simple change of mind.</Text>

<Text>And the way we are going to do this is by playing around with our focus and attention in a unique way.</Text>

<Text>I would definitely describe it as a fun exercise, which ultimately has you utilising your imagination in order to practice the unlimited number of ways we can develop and utilise focus.</Text>

<Text>It will also help introduce you to a way of thinking which has unique applications when it comes to learning, if you so choose to use it.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>In order to practice this exercise, you&rsquo;ll first need to pay attention to your surroundings.</Text>

<Text>For starters, attempt to take note of the various objects within your surrounding area.</Text>

<Text>It could be a door. It could be a lamp on your desk. Perhaps even a plant or tree outside.</Text>

<Text>Now, with this information in mind I want you to place your focus and attention onto one of these objects.</Text>

<Text>Noticing this object, I want you to really take note of it&rsquo;s shape, as well as how the object would feel in your hands or what you would do if you had to interact with it.</Text>

<Text>Really think about this object and place it at the centre of your conscious attention.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Now, with your attention remained on this object, I want you to close your eyes.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Continuing to pay attention to this object, can you still feel it&rsquo;s presence in spite of the fact that you cannot see it?</Text>

<Text>Afterall the object is still there in your mind, and your attention is still on that object as if it were there, visually in front of you.</Text>

<Text>Now, with your eyes still closed, I now want you to imagine as if you&rsquo;re moving that object around with your mind.</Text>

<Text>Perhaps you might want to lift it up and move it to around to your left. Perhaps you might even want to spin it around 180 degrees, and then throw it behind your back.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>Use your imagination and see what you can do with this object.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Next, with your eyes still closed, I want you to place your attention on a different object you noticed earlier.</Text>

<Text>Do the same thing with this object as you did with the previous object.</Text>

<Text>Rinse and repeat.</Text>

<Text>While a lot of this may seem silly, the idea behind this exercise is to help you understand that there is nothing concrete, nor necessarily &lsquo;real&rsquo; about our ability to focus.</Text>

<Text>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s purely a self-created construct that is developed through practice (and largely desire).</Text>

<Text>And that really is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at here: Focus is nothing more than a skill that&rsquo;s developed through practice, exactly as you have been doing over the past 5 minutes or so.</Text>

<Text>There&rsquo;s nothing scary, nor mystic about it.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>It really is as simple as practicing these exercises on a consistent basis, in order to develop the skill of focus.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Once you understand this, then it helps you realise not only that we have full-control over our attention.</Text>

<Text>However that we can develop these simple understandings by changing the way we think about reality.</Text>

<Text>It really is that simple.</Text>

<Text>The same goes for all your urges and negative feelings surrounding your addiction. Much like your focus and attention, these things are entirely malleable and are in no way bound by anything in particular.</Text>

<Text>The sooner you realise this, the sooner you&rsquo;ll be able to overcome your addiction without the constant struggle that often comes with fighting our feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>All you have to do is change the way you interpret reality.</Text>

<Text>By practicing these exercises everyday.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Can You Look Through Walls?</Text>
        



<Text>The idea behind this exercise is to teach you to think of your senses differently.</Text>

<Text>As humans we&rsquo;re essentially limited by our senses. Which is to say that we can only see, feel and hear as far as our body will allow.</Text>

<Text>What this exercise is designed to do is help us imagine what it would be like if our senses were extended.</Text>

<Text>A large part of the exercises here on NeverFap Deluxe revolve around training ourselves to perceive and understand our senses, and so learning to imagine them is an important part of enhancing that process.</Text>

<Text>Because when you think about it, our senses really are the rawest indications of not only who we are, but what we know of reality.</Text>

<Text>So once you understand your senses and truly become comfortable with them, you can learn to develop great control over your mind, as well as cement your ability to remain centred.</Text>

<Text>Not only will this exercise help you better understand your existing senses and your perceived limitations of them, however it will help you better project your understandings of reality overall.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise, what we want to do pretend as if we can see through walls.</Text>

<Text>So pick a wall, and pretend as if you can see clearly what is on the other side.</Text>

<Text>Now, this truly is a skill within it&rsquo;s own and I encourage you to really play around with this idea of what it means to be able to &ldquo;see through something&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text>For example, can you see through multiple walls? If so, can walls ever exist out of principle, if no one can see them?</Text>

<Text>What does it look like on the other side? Is it clear? Does the fact that because you&rsquo;re looking through something, change the nature of that object?</Text>

<Text>Is your ability to see through walls a reflection of your eyes, or your mind? Perhaps, is it a reflection of the wall itself? Is it only walls you can see through?</Text>

<Text>In addition, see if you can imagine different things through that same wall. Perhaps you see a great big ocean, or a vast wide desert. Perhaps it&rsquo;s nothing more than just a single colour.</Text>

<Text>By playing around with this idea, you can truly explore your senses in a magical way, that will help you not only realise how fantastically fluid they really are.</Text>

<Text>But also dissolve the self-limiting beliefs you may have about them.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, the intention behind <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Every 30 Minutes</Text> is to help keep a constant gauge of what you&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text>And by doing so, gain a deeper understanding of awareness and routine, in particular of your own life and how you play it out each day.</Text>

<Text>Routine is a very important part of the recovery process, and this exercise is a way to streamline that process, or at least get you thinking about it in a meaningful way.</Text>

<Text>In addition, it&rsquo;s a wonderful way to engage your brain, which is really half the battle when it comes to addressing porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>Essentially, your aim with this exercise is to keep a mental timer every 30 minutes, and to record or even just acknowledge what you&rsquo;re doing within in that moment.</Text>

<Text>In order for this to be effective, you will not be using an alarm to do this.</Text>

<Text>Instead, you will be using your own intuition, and then checking the clock to see what time it is, and whether you should record what you&rsquo;re doing yet.</Text>

<Text>The whole idea is that we want to develop this mental timeline ourselves, and the only way we can do this is through practice.</Text>

<Text>Put simply, an alarm is not a substitute for your own conscious awareness, which is what we are attempting to develop.</Text>

<Text>Personally I find it helps to do this exercise starting at a time like 8:00am in order to make it easier to track those 30 minute segment.</Text>

<Text>Although, you&rsquo;re free to do whatever interval works best for you. For example, you might want to experiment with hourly intervals instead.</Text>

<Text>(although I tend to find the longer the duration, the harder it is for people starting out)</Text>

<Text>In addition, I want to add that this is can be a real tough one!</Text>

<Text>Although it sounds easy in practice, humans tend to forget. It&rsquo;s a bit like when we feel distracted during meditation, and we find ourselves thinking about something irrelevant.</Text>

<Text>Sometimes we can have a hard time maintaining our conscious awareness, however this is precisely why we&rsquo;re practicing this exercise.</Text>

<Text>So we can focus on what&rsquo;s important.</Text>

<Text>Our mental health.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Focus Your Attention On The Right Side Of Your Vision</Text>
        <Text>This is another classic awareness exercise which is short and straight-to-the-point.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s designed to help you think about something which you ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t think about, which can help you expand your conscious awareness.</Text>

<Text>I suppose what I like about this particular variation of awareness exercise, is that it really points out how subtle our focus and attention can be.</Text>

<Text>While there are much more demanding awareness exercises such as Observe Your Senses this exercise highlights that focus and attention can still be achieved in the day-to-day of our busy lives.</Text>

<Text>And that&rsquo;s really the beauty of focus and attention.</Text>

<Text>As outlined in Blind Attention it can be absolutely anything you want it to be, it simply comes down to your ability to conceptually think about it in everyday situations, and this exercise is designed to help you do that.</Text>

<Text>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s get to the meat of it.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>For this exercise what you want to do is focus your attention on the right side of your vision.</Text>

<Text>I find this exercise works most effectively while you&rsquo;re in the middle of doing something, because it&rsquo;s not designed to be particularly taxing.</Text>

<Text>In fact, it&rsquo;s designed to exist as a subtle overlay over your current thinking and daily functioning, as opposed to a dedicated practice you do when you have 10 minutes to yourself.</Text>

<Text>I tend to find the real benefit of this exercise comes from how we decide to focus on the right side of our vision.</Text>

<Text>For example, you may want to physically look at something in the right side of your vision. Alternatively, you may decide to simply imagine something appearing in the right side of your vision.</Text>

<Text>In a lot of cases, it can be as simple as acknowledging that you have a right arm. There&rsquo;s an infinite number of ways you can practice this exercise throughout the day.</Text>

<Text>Furthermore, another important aspect of this exercise is consistency. Try to see how often and how long you can maintain your attention on the right side of your vision for.</Text>

<Text>Not to mention, question why you think you&rsquo;ve been successful/unsuccessful in doing so.</Text>

<Text>Do you get distracted when you attempt to focus your attention on the right side of your vision? Do you find it hard placing your focus on anything at all?</Text>

<Text>Certainly, as with all awareness exercises, the more you practice them the better you&rsquo;ll become at training your mind to think in those terms.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>What Can Your Hand Do?</Text>
        

<Text>This exercise is designed to help you think outside of the box.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s not a particularly difficult exercise in the sense that it allows for unlimited creativity.</Text>

<Text>However, it&rsquo;s an exercise that&rsquo;s very difficult to master in the traditional sense of being able to consistently replicate the same thing each time.</Text>

<Text>I find I learn new things each time I try this exercise, and you&rsquo;ll be surprised at the extent to which you&rsquo;ll also discover new things each time you try it too.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>In this exercise what we'll be doing is coming up with a variety of different ways we can use our hands.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>How we can move them. Arrange them. Touch them.</Text>

<Text>And in doing so, realise the extent to which we haven&rsquo;t been thinking before, or at least allowed ourselves the opportunity to think previously.</Text>

<Text>Because although we use our hands everyday, it&rsquo;s not as if we think about them in certain odd ways, such as how we can arrange them into different shapes and patterns.</Text>

<Text>I suppose it&rsquo;s a lot like when you&rsquo;re walking down a street you&rsquo;re familiar with, and you happen to notice something completely new that&rsquo;s always been there, yet you hadn&rsquo;t noticed up until that very moment.</Text>

<Text>By practicing this exercise we can learn to not only think creatively, but also understand that no matter how much we think we know, we don&rsquo;t truly know it all.</Text>

<Text>Something which often has to be experienced to be believed, hence this exercise.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>To begin this exercise I want you to first look at your hand.</Text>

<Text>What do you see? Take notice of the wrinkles on your knuckles. The hair on your fingers. The tone of your skin.</Text>

<Text>Already, you&rsquo;re probably doing something unique. Chances are you&rsquo;ve never considered staring at your hand for an extended period of time, ever.</Text>

<Text>Next try and move your fingers around. See if you can make your hand into weird shapes by moving your fingers into odd positions.</Text>

<Text>What happens once you move your wrist as well? Does it feel natural? What is natural?</Text>

<Text>Once you&rsquo;ve played around with that idea, get your other hand involved as well.</Text>

<Text>What arrangements/combinations can you create with two hands? What if you interlace all your fingers together? What if you put both the backs of your hands together?</Text>

<Text>Remember, this truly is an exercise of creativity, so the aim is to play around and see what you can come up with.</Text>

<Text>Not only will it help open up your mind, but it will get you thinking about something which you ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about.</Text>

<Text>No different to your recovery if you&rsquo;re just starting out.</Text>

        <Text style={content__title}>Focus On Your Finger And Your Background</Text>
        <Text>This is a simple exercise most people can benefit from straight-away without too much effort.</Text>

<Text>Certainly, it was one of the first awareness exercises I learnt when I was starting out with my own mental health journey, and it&rsquo;s one that has stuck with me since.</Text>

<Text>This exercise involves manipulating your visual field in order to change the depth perception of the objects in front of you, notably your finger and the foreground.</Text>

<Text>It&rsquo;s a powerful exercise because humans are largely visual creatures, and so to rapidly change our focus so vividly can help us better understand the power which we have over ourselves and our perception of reality.</Text>

<Text>At a conscious level, we may not realise the extent to which we have control over ourselves and in particular our thoughts, feelings and even senses.</Text>

<Text>On the other hand, demonstrating first-hand that we do have control over these things aspects of our consciousness is a great way to open our minds and dissolve some of the self-limiting beliefs we may have about what we&rsquo;re capable of as people.</Text>

<Text>In other words, help us detach from the misconceptions within our own minds, including our ego and all things conceptual.</Text>

<Text>And the fact that what we&rsquo;re doing here is conscious is really key here, as we&rsquo;re trying to demonstrate power over our mind through our actions.</Text>

<Text>Because that&rsquo;s ultimately what awareness is all about - learning to use our minds effectively so we no longer allow our subconscious fears and behaviours to control who we are.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>While the instructions for this exercise are simple, the real benefit comes from the introspection that comes from practicing this exercise.</Text>

<Text>No different to any other awareness exercises.</Text>

<Text>In order to practice this exercise, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is place your hand in front of your face with one finger pointing up.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, have it far away enough so you can see your finger clearly, but not so close that&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.</Text>

<Text>Now, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is focus on that finger. Simply focus your vision on that finger, and notice what you see.</Text>

<Text>If practiced successfully, you should be able to see your finger very clearly. I mean, it is right in front of your face, afterall.</Text>

<Text>Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you able to focus on anything else while focusing on your finger? What about the background, are you able to focus on that as well?</Text>

<Text>Once you&rsquo;ve done this for about a minute-or-so, I now want you to focus your attention on something in the background.</Text>

<Text>It could be a tree. It could be something on you wall. Generally, the further away it is the better this works.</Text>

<Text>And with your focus shifted, I want you to gauge your change of perspective and truly understand the significance of what you&rsquo;ve achieved here.</Text>

<Text>With your focus on that object in the distance, what do you notice? Are you able to see your finger clearly at all?</Text>

<Text>Ultimately, this exercise teaches us a few different things.</Text>

<Text>It teaches us that although we can have two objects in front of us, where we place our attention ultimately dictates what our experience will be.</Text>

<Text>In addition, it also teaches us the importance that we play as individuals in regards to how we perceive reality.</Text>

<Text>When we focused on the background, our finger itself didn&rsquo;t change. What changed was our perception of that finger, due to where we placed our attention.</Text>

<Text>There are also a number of additional lessons we can learn from this exercise, however I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you to explore!</Text>
