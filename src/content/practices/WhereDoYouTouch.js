        <Text><b>Where Do You Touch?</b> is another classic awareness exercise which is designed to help you develop focus and attention.</Text>

<Text>By &ldquo;classic&rdquo; I mean it&rsquo;s another variation of the tried-and-true &ldquo;pay attention to X thing throughout the day&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen in abundance on this website.</Text>

<Text>Well, the reason why I write so many of them is because they&rsquo;re incredibly effective at getting you to think about awareness in a unique way.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<h3>In essence, because this is what you should be doing with your attention anyway.</h3>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text>Which is to say that you should be practicing awareness in everything you do, and that this exercise is merely a shortcut to having you eventually do this automatically.</Text>

<Text>Awareness is important because it&rsquo;s what allows you to understand and learn your own behaviours, not only to change them, but also to enhance them.</Text>

<Text>By practicing awareness in any capacity, we train our ability to catch ourselves doing silly things, like watching porn when we&rsquo;re feeling stressed.</Text>

<Text>And instead, consciously decide within that moment, to replace that unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy coping mechanism instead.</Text>

<Text>The more we practice this, the more it will help us to think in terms of using our awareness in an empowering way, and eventually it will become second-nature to us.</Text>

<Text>Overtime we will become more aware of all our behaviours and quirks, and this is when we will develop full-control over our lives.</Text>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text>In this exercise we&rsquo;re going to be paying attention to our body and how it interacts with touch.</Text>

<Text>Essentially, I want you to take note of whenever you&rsquo;re touching something.</Text>

<Text>For example, I&rsquo;m currently using my fingers to tap against this keyboard in order to type these words.</Text>

<Text>And yet although it&rsquo;s something I spend most my day doing, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve ever really thought about.</Text>

<Text>Well, that&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to address. To begin thinking about behaviours which your brain has subconsciously ignored for decades.</Text>

<Text>For example, your response to masturbate daily as a way to deal with certain feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text>In addition, an important aspect of this exercise is to pay attention to the feeling of touch as well.</Text>

<Text>What does it feel like when you bump into something? Does it hurt when you touch something? Does it feel hot or cold? Does it evoke emotion?</Text>

<Text>Only by becoming aware of our senses can we not only learn to better understand how they relate to our conscious experience.</Text>

<Text>However it can help us to better control the experience itself once we become aware of our behaviours related to touch.</Text>
